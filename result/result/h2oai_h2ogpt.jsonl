There is the more or less solid and weight-bearing portion toward your front, called ‚Äúthe vertebral body‚Äù (with the discs in between). And then there‚Äôs this flying buttress‚Äìlooking piece that sticks off the back (the ‚Äúvertebral arch‚Äù). And there is a very important space between the two sections. The ‚Äúhollow‚Äù down the middle of your spine is really a space between these two segments of the vertebra. The vertebra is one solid piece of bone but with two very distinct segments and a hole down the middle where the spinal cord goes. \\nThe Spinal Column\\n\\nDo you see the spiny-looking pieces in the picture, above, sticking off the vertebrae? Those are pieces of the vertebral arch. They are called ‚Äúthe spinous processes‚Äù (no one cares), and they are basically anchor points. That‚Äôs where ligaments can attach muscles to the vertebrae. If you‚Äôre a sailor, think of cleats on the deck, for ropes. When you reach back and feel the spiny part of your back, you‚Äôre feeling the ‚Äúspinous processes‚Äù or the cleats. By the way, the ligaments or sinews are the lines (think ‚Äústays‚Äù on a sailboat) that hold your spine erect. Without stays, the mast on a sailboat would flop around and break in no time; with stays, the mast on a well-designed sailboat is remarkably stable. Flexible, like your spine, but stable and strong, too. \\nOkeydoke, on to the discs. This is familiar territory to most of us. You hear about discs all the time. ‚ÄúBulging discs,‚Äù ‚Äúpinched discs,‚Äù ‚Äúslipped discs,‚Äù ‚Äúruptured discs‚Äù and so on. They are basically washers to keep the weight-bearing parts of the vertebrae from rubbing on one another and to put some ‚Äúgive‚Äù into your back. You cannot have an articulated stack of bones without a wonderfully effective stack of washers to keep ‚Äôem apart, and you do. Think of them as very tough jelly doughnuts, as I mentioned before. There is a tough, fibrous layer on the outside and a gooey or liquid core on the inside. They act as shock absorbers and have a lot to do with letting you bend. Dysfunctional discs can be a major source of problems and pain. \\nA YOUNG PERSON‚ÄôS PROBLEMS\\nThis is interesting. Bulging and actually ruptured discs are mostly a young person‚Äôs problem, people in their thirties (and you kids are welcome to them; they really hurt). Older people have horrendous problems, too; after all, some 35 percent of people from ages forty-five to sixty-five have serious back pain. But usually not this particular horror. Which also means that more younger people are going to get bundled off to the surgeon, if the problem is grim enough. Older people have disc problems, too, but nowhere near as often. \\nTake a long look at the pictures on the next pages. They show you how the spinal cord, spine, and discs work together. First is a side view depicting how the brain, spinal cord, and spine are positioned in the body. Second is a close-up of a segment made up of two vertebrae with their disc (in gray) in between and the spinal cord and nerve roots visible. Notice how the rear parts of the adjoining vertebrae form a canal through which the spinal cord runs from top to bottom. Also notice how the two adjoining vertebrae form holes, or ‚Äúforamina,‚Äù on the sides where the nerve roots come out of the spine. Those holes are super-important: The holes can become smaller from disc degeneration or movement of the vertebrae on top of each other. And the nerve that comes out of the hole is pressured, and it hurts like blazes. Not to get too scary, but when things really go to hell and you actually rupture or split the disc open with your ridiculous posture or whatnot, the pain really goes over the top. (Good news: You hear about ruptured discs all the time, but they are comparatively rare.) Bones wear on bones, discs hurt like crazy, and the stuff in the middle squirts all over the place. Which is bad because it causes severe chemical pain in the nerves. Not so good. When we say that there are times when traditional medicine (surgery) has a critical role, this is one of them. \\nNote the bits of bone to the left in the close-up side view vertebral segment. These are ‚Äúthe facet joints.‚Äù The point of this picture is to show how they are right next to the spinal cord and near one of the nerve exit spots. They are well placed, in other words, to raise hell if things go wrong with them. I forgot to mention this: The surfaces of the facet joints are covered in cartilage, which allows smooth movement in a healthy spine. So what? The point is that this cartilage can be abraded or torn by dumb moves, too, and that hurts as well. \\nHere are two more views, below. Note the sort of circular thing with the lighter insides. That‚Äôs a cross section of a disc, seen from the top. \\n\\nLigaments and Tendons\\nAll right, that‚Äòs the spinal cord and the spinal column. But they would not stand alone without a ton of support. Think of the spinal column as a slender reed. If you press down on it at all from above (or the sides), it will bend crazily. Indeed, it cannot sustain any weight at all to speak of. But now, add a bunch of support lines from the pole to a solid support, and it‚Äôs a different story. Our backbone has a lot of very sturdy support lines called ligaments and tendons (ligaments connect bone to bone; tendons connect bone to muscle.) There are an awful lot of ligaments connected to the spine. The following picture gives you the idea. \\nHere‚Äôs another thing you need to know: Ligaments can become deformed or sprained because of bad posture, a persistent pattern of bad movements, or an injury. When that happens to a ligament, the joints those ligaments were supporting ‚Äúget loose‚Äù and can slip around. That is really bad. Here is a language alert: A ‚Äúsprain‚Äù is an unhealthy stretch or tear of a ligament, and a ‚Äústrain‚Äù is an unhealthy stretch or tear in a tendon or muscle. Look at the picture on the opposite page: there are a ton of ligaments here, all waiting to go haywire if you are foolish or unlucky. \\nSpinal Ligaments',\n                 'iinput_nochat': '',\n                 'prompt': 'I confess, with only a touch of embarrassment, that I had no idea until we started working on this book that each vertebra was really a two-part bone.

There is a tough, fibrous layer on the outside and a gooey or liquid core on the inside. They act as shock absorbers and have a lot to do with letting you bend. Dysfunctional discs can be a major source of problems and pain. \\nA YOUNG PERSON‚ÄôS PROBLEMS\\nThis is interesting. Bulging and actually ruptured discs are mostly a young person‚Äôs problem, people in their thirties (and you kids are welcome to them; they really hurt). Older people have horrendous problems, too; after all, some 35 percent of people from ages forty-five to sixty-five have serious back pain. But usually not this particular horror. Which also means that more younger people are going to get bundled off to the surgeon, if the problem is grim enough. Older people have disc problems, too, but nowhere near as often. \\nTake a long look at the pictures on the next pages. They show you how the spinal cord, spine, and discs work together. First is a side view depicting how the brain, spinal cord, and spine are positioned in the body. Second is a close-up of a segment made up of two vertebrae with their disc (in gray) in between and the spinal cord and nerve roots visible. Notice how the rear parts of the adjoining vertebrae form a canal through which the spinal cord runs from top to bottom. Also notice how the two adjoining vertebrae form holes, or ‚Äúforamina,‚Äù on the sides where the nerve roots come out of the spine. Those holes are super-important: The holes can become smaller from disc degeneration or movement of the vertebrae on top of each other. And the nerve that comes out of the hole is pressured, and it hurts like blazes. Not to get too scary, but when things really go to hell and you actually rupture or split the disc open with your ridiculous posture or whatnot, the pain really goes over the top. (Good news: You hear about ruptured discs all the time, but they are comparatively rare.) Bones wear on bones, discs hurt like crazy, and the stuff in the middle squirts all over the place. Which is bad because it causes severe chemical pain in the nerves. Not so good. When we say that there are times when traditional medicine (surgery) has a critical role, this is one of them. \\nNote the bits of bone to the left in the close-up side view vertebral segment. These are ‚Äúthe facet joints.‚Äù The point of this picture is to show how they are right next to the spinal cord and near one of the nerve exit spots. They are well placed, in other words, to raise hell if things go wrong with them. I forgot to mention this: The surfaces of the facet joints are covered in cartilage, which allows smooth movement in a healthy spine. So what? The point is that this cartilage can be abraded or torn by dumb moves, too, and that hurts as well. \\nHere are two more views, below. Note the sort of circular thing with the lighter insides. That‚Äôs a cross section of a disc, seen from the top. \\n\\nLigaments and Tendons\\nAll right, that‚Äòs the spinal cord and the spinal column. But they would not stand alone without a ton of support. Think of the spinal column as a slender reed. If you press down on it at all from above (or the sides), it will bend crazily. Indeed, it cannot sustain any weight at all to speak of. But now, add a bunch of support lines from the pole to a solid support, and it‚Äôs a different story. Our backbone has a lot of very sturdy support lines called ligaments and tendons (ligaments connect bone to bone; tendons connect bone to muscle.) There are an awful lot of ligaments connected to the spine. The following picture gives you the idea. \\nHere‚Äôs another thing you need to know: Ligaments can become deformed or sprained because of bad posture, a persistent pattern of bad movements, or an injury. When that happens to a ligament, the joints those ligaments were supporting ‚Äúget loose‚Äù and can slip around. That is really bad. Here is a language alert: A ‚Äúsprain‚Äù is an unhealthy stretch or tear of a ligament, and a ‚Äústrain‚Äù is an unhealthy stretch or tear in a tendon or muscle. Look at the picture on the opposite page: there are a ton of ligaments here, all waiting to go haywire if you are foolish or unlucky. \\nSpinal Ligaments',\n                 'top_k_docs': 10,\n                 'document_subset': DocumentSubset.Relevant.name,  # matches return\n                 'document_choice': np.array([]),  # matches return\n                 'document_content_substrings': np.array([]),  # matches return\n                 'document_source_substrings_op': 'and',\n                 'document_source_substrings': np.array([]),  # matches return\n                 'document_content_substrings_op': 'and',\n                 'langchain_agents': np.array([]),  # matches return\n                 'pre_prompt_query': None,\n                 'prompt_query': None,\n                 'pre_prompt_summary': None,\n                 'prompt_summary': None,\n                 'hyde_llm_prompt': None,\n                 'all_docs_start_prompt': None,\n                 'all_docs_finish_prompt': None,\n\n                 \"user_prompt_for_fake_system_prompt\": None,\n                 \"json_object_prompt\": None,\n                 \"json_object_prompt_simpler\": None,\n                 \"json_code_prompt\": None,\n                 \"json_code_prompt_if_no_schema\": None,\n                 \"json_schema_instruction\": None,\n                 \"json_preserve_system_prompt\": None,\n                 \"json_object_post_prompt_reminder\": None,\n                 \"json_code_post_prompt_reminder\": None,\n                 \"json_code2_post_prompt_reminder\": None,\n\n                 'system_prompt': 'auto',\n                 'pdf_loaders': np.array(['PyMuPDF'], dtype=object),\n                 'url_loaders': np.array(['Unstructured'], dtype=object),\n                 'jq_schema': '.[]',\n                 'extract_frames': 10,\n                 'visible_models': None,\n                 'visible_image_models': None,\n                 'image_size': None,\n                 'image_quality': None,\n                 'image_guidance_scale': None,\n                 'image_num_inference_steps': None,\n                 'h2ogpt_key': None,\n                 'chat_conversation': None,\n                 'text_context_list': None,\n                 'docs_ordering_type': 'best_near_prompt',\n                 'min_max_new_tokens': 512,\n                 'max_input_tokens': 3100 if base_model == 'h2oai/h2ogpt-oig-oasst1-512-6_9b' else -1,\n                 'llava_prompt': 'auto',\n                 'max_total_input_tokens': -1,\n                 'docs_token_handling': 'split_or_merge',\n                 'docs_joiner': docs_joiner_default,\n                 'hyde_level': 0,\n                 'hyde_template': None,\n                 'hyde_show_only_final': False,\n                 'doc_json_mode': False,\n                 'metadata_in_context': 'auto',\n                 'chatbot_role': 'None',\n                 'speaker': 'None',\n                 'tts_language': 'autodetect',\n                 'tts_speed': 1.0,\n                 'image_file': None,\n                 'image_control': None,\n                 'images_num_max': None,\n                 'image_resolution': None,\n                 'image_format': None,\n                 'video_frame_period': None,\n                 'response_format': 'text',\n                 'guided_json': '',\n                 'guided_regex': '',\n                 'guided_choice': '',\n                 'guided_grammar': '',\n                 'guided_whitespace_pattern': None,\n                 'client_metadata': None,\n                 }\n    if cpu and bits == 32:\n        expected1.update({'image_audio_loaders': np.array([], dtype=object)})\n    else:\n        expected1.update({'image_audio_loaders': np.array(['Caption'], dtype=object)})\n\n    expected1.update({k: v for k, v in kwargs.items() if\n                      k not in ['load_half', 'load_4bit', 'load_8bit', 'load_gptq', 'load_awq', 'load_exllama', 'use_safetensors']})\n    drop_keys = ['document_choice',\n                 'document_source_substrings', 'document_source_substrings_op', 'document_content_substrings', 'document_content_substrings_op',\n                 'langchain_agents', 'image_audio_loaders']  # some numpy things annoying to match\n    expected1 = {k: v for k, v in expected1.items() if k not in drop_keys}\n    actual1 = {k: v for k, v in actual1.items() if k not in drop_keys}\n    assert sorted(actual1.items()) == sorted(expected1.items())\n    actual2 = {k: v for k, v in zip(columns, result_list) if k in key_separate}\n\n    import torch\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        if bits == 4:\n            expected2 = {\n                'response': \"\"\"The spinal ligaments are the thick bands of tissue that connect the vertebrae of the spine.

If n is greater than 1, the function iterates over the range of integers from 2 to n-1, adding the previous two Fibonacci numbers to get the current Fibonacci number.

For exam-\nple, inputs to LLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023) must be fewer than 2048 tokens. This pre-set\ncontext window limit is frequently exceeded in applications such as conducting long conversations,\nsummarizing long documents, or executing long-term planning. For these applications, LLMs with\nlonger context windows are preferred. However, training an LLM from scratch with long context\nwindows requires significant investments. This naturally leads to a question: Can we extend the\ncontext window of an existing pre-trained LLM?\n\nOne straightforward approach is to fine-tune an existing pre-trained Transformer with a longer con-\ntext window. However, empirically, we found that models trained this way adapt to long context\nwindows very slowly. After training for more than 10000 batches, the effective context window\nsaw a minimal increase, moving from 2048 to 2560 (Table 4). This suggests that such method is\ninefficient for extending to substantially longer context windows.\n\nWhile certain techniques such as ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) and LeX (Sun et al., 2022) enable length\nextrapolation of Transformers, i.e. train on short context windows and inference on longer ones,\nmany existing pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), use positional encodings\nthat have weak extrapolation properties (e.g., RoPE (Su et al., 2021)). Therefore, the applicability\nof these techniques for extending the context window sizes of such LLMs remains limited.\n\nIn this work, we introduce Position Interpolation to enable context window extensions for certain\nexisting pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA. The key idea is, instead of extrapolation, we directly\ndown-scale the position indices so that the maximum position index matches the previous context\nwindow limit in the pre-training stage. See Figure 1 for an illustration. In other words, to accom-\nmodate more input tokens, we interpolate the position encodings at neighboring integer positions,\nutilizing the fact that position encodings can be applied on non-integer positions, as opposed to\nextrapolating outside the trained positions, which may lead to catastrophic values. We verify our\napproach theoretically, by showing that the interpolated attention score has a much smaller upper\n\nbound (~ 600x smaller in LLaMA 7B setting) than the extrapolated one, and is thus much more\nstable. Therefore, interpolated position encodings are easier for the model to adapt.\n\nEmpirically, we found that Position Interpolation is highly effective and efficient, requiring only a\nvery short period of fine-tuning for the model to fully adapt to greatly extended context windows.\nWe present experimental results for extending the context window to up to 32768 from the initial\n2048 across 7B to 65B LLaMA models using Position Interpolation. Our results show that\n\n1. Position Interpolation can easily enable very long context windows (e.g. 32768), requiring\nonly fine-tuning for 1000 steps on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020) to achieve a good quality.\nThe cost of fine-tuning is negligible compared to the pre-training costs. This confirms\nour hypothesis that it is relatively easy for the models to adapt to interpolated position\nencodings.\n\n2. Position Interpolation generates strong models that can effectively make use of much ex-\ntended context window. We show that models extended by Position Interpolation enjoy\nsignificant perplexity gains from greatly extended context windows for text modeling, and\nwe show that the perplexity reduces graceful with the enlargement of context windows.\nWe also applied Position Interpolation in a long text summarization task, and demonstrate\ncompetitive performances.\n\n3. Position Interpolation preserves model quality relatively well for tasks within its original\ncontext window sizes. We present a variety of evaluation results for the extended LLaMA\nmodels on the original LLaMA benchmark. Compared with original LLaMA models, the\nextended LLLaM A models saw a minor degradation on several standard benchmarks within\na 2048 token limit.\n\nOur results highlight the innate ability of Transformer models to ‚Äúextrapolate to sequence lengths\nlonger than the ones encountered during training‚Äù as hypothesized in the seminal work of Vaswani\net al. (2017). We reaffirm this hypothesis and suggest that the previously known weakness of ex-\ntrapolating to longer sequences for language modeling (Press et al., 2022) may be due to direct\n\nextrapolation of positional encodings and it can be largely mitigated by interpolating position en-\ncodings instead.\n\nConcurrent work. Right before our release, we are informed with a concurrent blogpost (Super-\nHOT kaiokendev (2023)) that also interpolates positional encoding in RoPE to extend the context\nwindow from 2K to 8K. Recently, open source community picks it up in Reddit post ! and Github\nIssues 2, which shows that fine-tuning with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) also seems to work well. Our\npaper shows a full fine-tuning with up to 65B model work well with Position Interpolation, and we\nalso give theoretical explanations why interpolation achieves much more stable results than extrap-\nolation, by showing that the upper bound of interplated attention score is much lower than that of\nextrapolated ones.\n\n2 METHOD\n\n2.1 BACKGROUND: ROTARY POSITION EMBEDDING (ROPE)\n\nTransformer models require explicit positional information to be injected, typically in the form of\npositional encodings, to represent the order of inputs. We consider Rotary Position Embedding\n(ROPE) (Su et al., 2021), which is the position encoding used in the LLLaMA model (Touvron et al.,\n2023). Given a position index m ‚Ç¨ [0, ¬¢) and an embedding vector x := [zg, 71,..., 241], Where\nd is the dimension of the attention head, RoPE defines a vector-valued complex function f{x, m) as\nfollows\n\nUsing RoPE, the self-attention score\nis only dependent on relative position m ‚Äî 7 through trigonometric functions. Here q and k are the\nquery and key vector for a specific attention head. At each layer, RoPE is applied on both query and\nkey embeddings for computing attention scores.\n\n2.2 DIRECT EXTRAPOLATION\n\nWhile the attention score in RoPE only depends on the relative positions, which is what we want,\nits extrapolation performance is not great . In particular, when directly extending to larger context\nwindows unseen in the training, the perplexity may shoot up to very high numbers (i.e., > 10%),\ncomparable to untrained models.\n\nIdeally, we want to see the model trained on a context window of size L = 2048 to still work\nreasonably well on longer context window, but may not have the capability to leverage information\nthat appears beyond L. For example, to answer a question located at 3000, the model trained on\nmaximal window size of I = 2048 cannot leverage evidences provided at location 0, but still\ncan leverage the evidences provided at location 2900. In contrast, in reality we see catastrophic\nbehaviors, i.e., question at location 3000 cannot be answered correctly, even if the evidences are\nlocated at location 2900.\n\nWhat is the reason behind? How could this happen if the attention score a,,,‚Äî,, decays as the relative\ndistance |m ‚Äî n/| increases, according to Section 3.4.3 of (Su et al., 2021), and content from very\nfar distances should not matter that much? It turns out that the upper bound derived in Section 3.4.3\nof (Su et al., 2021) may be too loose: while it indeed decays with respect to |m ‚Äî nl, the bound\ncan still be quite large (i.e., the bound can be critically depends on the magnitude of v;) and thus\nvacuous. In fact, if we treat all trigonometric functions as basis functions (i.e, ¬¢;(s) := #93), and\nthink about Eqn. 2 as basis expansion as the following:\n\nwhere s is the positional span between a query and a key and h; := (ga; + igaj+1){k2j ‚Äî tk2j+1)\nare complex coefficients depending on q and k (here the definition of h; is exactly the same as the\ndefinition of k; in Sec 3.4.3 in RoPE (Su et al., 2021)). Now the the issue becomes clear: as shown\nin Fig. 2, a, can be small in magnitude in the range of [0, 2048], but gives huge values out of the\nregion. The underlying reason is that the trigonometric family {¬¢;} (with sufficiently large d) is\na universal approximator and can fit any arbitrary functions. Therefore, for a, there always exist\ncoefficients {h;} (i.e. key and query) that corresponds to small function values in [0, 2048] but\n\nmuch larger in regions beyond.\n\n2.3 PROPOSED APPROACH: POSITION INTERPOLATION (PI)\n\nIn Fig. 2, thanks to the smoothness of bases functions ¬¢; interpolation is much more stable and will\nnot lead to wild values. Therefore, instead of extrapolate the attention score in Eqn. 3 to s > L,\nhow about we define an attention score a{s) = a(Ls/L‚Äô) where L‚Äô is the longer context window?\nFormally, we replace RoPE f by {‚Äô defined as follows\n\nWe call this transformation on the position encoding Position Interpolation. In this step, we reduce\nposition indices from [0, L') to [0, L) to match the original range of indices before computing RoPE.\nConsequently, as inputs to RoPE, the maximum relative distance between any two tokens has been\nreduced from I‚Äô to L. Since we align the ranges of position indices and relative distances before\nand after extension, we mitigate the effect on attention score computation due to context window\nextensions, which can allow the model easier to adapt. To further demonstrate this is the case, in the\nfollowing theorem, we show that the interpolated attention score is well-behaved:\n\nWhile there is no close form for B(s) := 4/21 |Ag41(s)|, numerically it is at least larger than d, and for many positional difference s, B(s) is much larger than d\n(check Appendix B for the plot). Therefore, the interpolation bound is at least 2 - 294.73 ~ 600 x\nsmaller than the extrapolation bound, and thus the interpolated attention score is much more stable\nthan extrapolated one.\n\nNotably, our method of rescaling of position indices does not introduce extra weight, or modify\nthe model architecture in any way. This makes it attractive in practical applications, since most\ninfrastructure and optimization for the original model can be reused after the extension.\n\nFine-tuning. We can further fine-tune the interpolated model using the next token prediction task\nwith interpolated position encodings on the extended context window size using a pre-training cor-\npus such as the Pile (Gao et al., 2020). In the next section, we show that our fine-tuning process\nonly needs tens to hundreds thousands of examples. We also find that the result of the fine-tuning\nis not sensitive to the choice of examples. The reason may be that the model is only adapting to the\nnew context window during the fine-tuning phase, starting from a good initialization, as opposed to\nacquiring new knowledge.\n\nOther ways to reduce interpolation/extrapolation bound. From the expression of the interpola-\ntion (Eqn. 5) and extrapolation bound (Eqn. 8), a common term is max; ||, which is the maximal\nmagnitude of query/key products. If we enforce a regularization on || during LLM training, it is\npossible that the catastrophic extrapolation error can be mitigated or even resolved. In fact, if we\napply ridge regression with proper regularization to fit a curve in Fig. 2, the magnitude of extrapo-\nlated a(s) when s > L can be comparable to that within [0, L]. To our knowledge, we are not aware\nof existing LLM pre-training techniques that leverage this regularization and will leave it for future\nwork.\n\n3 EXPERIMENTS\n\nWe show Position Interpolation can effectively extend context window up to 32 times of the original\nsize, and such extension can be done with only several hundreds of training steps. We show the\nresulting models are strong LLMs with fully effective long context windows. We demonstrate its\nperformance in a number of tasks including language modeling, passkey retrieval, and long doc-\nument summarization. We also present benchmark results of the extended models on the original\nLLaMA evaluation benchmarks.\n3.1 SETUP\n\nModel Variants. We extended the pre-trained 7B, 13B, 33B and 65B LLaMA models (Touvron\net al., 2023) to various context window of sizes up to 32768, using either direct fine-tuning or\nPosition Interpoloation method. Except for rescaling the position indices for models extended with\nPosition Interpolation, we did not modify LLaMA model architectures (Touvron et al., 2023) in any\nways.\n\nTraining Procedure. We fine-tune all model variants using the next token prediction objective. We\nuse AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) with 5; = 0.9 and 2 = 0.95. We use a linear learning\nrate warmup of 20 steps starting from 10% of the maximum learning rate. For 7B and 13B models,\nwe set the learning rate to 2 x 1075 and for 33B and 65B models we set the learning rate to 1072. We\nset the weight decay to zero. For extending 7B, 13B and 33B models to the 8192 context window\nsize, we use 32 A100 GPUs and 64 global batch size. For all other cases we use 128 A100 GPUs and\n128 global batch size. We note that the main need of using more GPUs is memory limitation during\nfine-tuning, and it is possible to use fewer GPUs in certain cases. We train all models using PyTorch\n(Paszke et al., 2019) with Fully Sharded Data Parallel (Zhao et al., 2023) and Flash Attention (Dao\net al., 2022).\n\nIf not specified otherwise, for the Position Interpolation method, we fine-tune the models for 1000\nsteps. For the direct fine-tuning method, we use 10000 steps. We primarily fine-tune using the Pile\ntraining dataset (Gao et al., 2020). In Section 3.4 we also compared fine-tuning performance on the\nRedPajama dataset (Computer, 2023).\n\n3.2 LONG SEQUENCE LANGUAGE MODELING\n\nWe evaluate the long sequence language modeling performance of our extended models and base-\nlines on two datasets: book corpus (PG-19) (Rae et al., 2020) and cleaned Arxiv Math proof-pile\ndataset (Azerbayev et al., 2022).\n\nWe use the test splits of PG19 (Rae et al., 2020) and proof-pile (Azerbayev et al., 2022). For PG19,\nwe use the whole test split consisting of 100 documents. For the proof-pile dataset, we use a random\nsubsample of 128 documents with at least 32768 SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) tokens\nand truncate to the first 32768 tokens for each test document. We evaluate perplexity at various\ncontext window size by using a sliding window approach following Press et al. (2022) with stride\nS = 256.\n\nIn Table 1 and Table 2, we report the perplexity results for our models and baselines on the datasets.\nFrom the results, we found that models extended with our method enjoy a significantly improved\nperplexity from longer context window sizes. By increasing the context window size from 2048 to\n16384, we observed -0.28 and -0.5 reductions of perplexity for extending LLaMA 7B models on\nboth datasets, -0.27 and -0.48 reductions for extending LL.aMA 13B models, and -0.14 and -0.42\nreductions for extending LLaMA 33B models. For LLaMA 65B models, we observed -0.12 and\n-0.3 reductions of perplexity by extending to the 8192 context window size.\n\nIn general, we observed a consistent trend of our models achieving better perplexity with longer\ncontext windows. This indicates our models can effectively make use of the longer context windows\nto better predict next tokens in language modeling tasks. Moreover, we found this trend extends to\n32768 window size without diminishing on the PG19 dataset for LLaMA 7B and 13B models. This\nindicates that our method may enable extension to even longer context windows.\n\nIn contrast, we observed that models extended via the direct fine-tuning method has shown regres-\nsion (up to +0.48) or minor improvement (up to -0.12) on the perplexity at longer context windows.\nThis indicates that models extended this way have limited capability of making use of context win-\ndows longer than their pre-trained settings.\n\nWe saw a minor degradation of the perplexity on the original context window of 2048 for our ex-\ntended models in some cases. For example, on the Proof-pile dataset, we saw a degradation ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 0.05 across all models with extended with Position Interpolation. A small degradation\nof performance within original evaluation context window is expected since Position Interpolation\nforces position encodings in original context window to reside in a much narrower region, which\nmay negatively affect the language model‚Äôs performance. We present more benchmark results on\nthe original context window size in Section 3.4.\n\nIn Table 3 we report the relationship between perplexity and the number of fine-tuning steps for\nLLaMA 7B model extending to 8192 and 16384 context window sizes using Position Interpolation\nevaluated on the PG19 dataset. We can see without fine-tuning (at step 0) the model can exhibit\ncertain language modeling capability, as indicated by < 20 perplexity for extending to 8192 context\nwindow (in contrast, the direct extrapolation method leads to > 10% perplexity). With fine-tuning,\nwe observed that the perplexity improves quickly. At 200 steps the models surpassed the original\nmodel‚Äôs perplexity on 2048 context window size, indicating the models gaining ability of effectively\nusing sequences longer than the pre-training settings for language modeling. At 1000 steps, we can\nsee the models have improved steadily and achieve a significantly better perplexity.\n\n3.3 MEASURING EFFECTIVE CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE THROUGH PASSKEY RETRIEVAL\n\nWe study the effective context window size, i.e. the maximum distance of a token can effectively\nattend to during inference, of our models after extension. To measure this, we follow a synthetic\nevaluation task of passkey retrieval proposed by Mohtashami & Jaggi (2023). In this task, the models\nare asked to recover a random passkey hidden in a long document. See Figure 3 for the format of\nthe document.\n\nGiven a language model, we estimate the upper and lower bounds of effective context windows as\nfollows. Suppose the random passkey is k tokens away from the end of the input. When a model\npersistently fails to retrieve the correct passkey value across several independent attempts, it suggests\nthat the effective context window size of the model is less than k. Conversely, if a model consistently\nsucceeds in retrieving the correct passkey value, we deduce that the effective context window size\nof the model is at least k.\n\nWe evaluate the 7B and 33B LLaMA model variants that are extended via Position Interpolation or\ndirect fine-tuning. For each model, we use 32 different &¬£ uniformly spaced in the targeted context\nwindow L‚Äô and run the above tests for 10 times for each k, where each time a random passkey of 5\nrandom digits is used. In Table 4, we report kyax as a function of the number of fine-tuning steps,\n\nWe can see that models extended via Position Interpolation all successfully attain their desired ex-\ntension objectives in terms of effective context window sizes, indicating by the effective context\nwindow size reaching maximum kp, = L/, after merely fine-tuning for 200 steps, consistently\nacross both 7B and 33B model sizes and up to 32768 context windows. In contrast, LLLaMA models\nthat are extended via direct fine-tuning only saw a minimal increase of the effective context win-\ndow size kay from 2048 to 2560, even after fine-tuning for more than 10000 steps, with no clear\nindication of an acceleration in the increase of window size.\n\n3.4 BENCHMARKS ON ORIGINAL CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE\n\nWe evaluate the models extended by Position Interpolation on several standard benchmark tasks\nwithin the original context window size of 2048. The evaluation results are listed in Table 5. From\nthe results, we saw that models extended to 8192 produce comparable results on the original bench-\nmark which is designed for a much smaller context window, with a degradation of up to 2% on\nthe benchmark tasks, for both 7B and 33B model sizes. Models extended to longer context win-\ndows regressed more on the benchmarks, but still in reasonable ranges for most tasks. We also note\nthat the choice of fine-tuning datasets does not seem to lead significant difference in the benchmark\nperformances, which may be due to the limited number of fine-tuning steps used in our method.\nThe regression on benchmark tasks is consistent with our observation on perplexity regression in\nSection 3.2.\n\n3.5 LONG DOCUMENT SUMMARIZATION\n\nIn this task, we evaluate our models‚Äô performance on the long document summarization task. In\nparticular, we consider the GovReport (Huang et al., 2021) dataset, which contains 17457 documents\nfor training and 972 documents for evaluation. Each document comes with a human generated\nsummary. We truncate all input documents to their first 15000 tokens.\n\nWe fine-tune the LL.aMA models extended with Position Interpolation with a context window of\n16384. Note the rescaling of position indices are still required during this fine-tuning step. We first\nModel Size Context Window Fine-tune on  BoolQ PIQA Race-M Race-H WinoGrande\n\nformat the raw document using the prompt template in Figure 4, and then concatenate the prompt\nwith the ground-truth summary (truncate to 1000 tokens) associated with each document. We fine-\ntune the model using the next token prediction task with the above setup for 10 epochs. The losses\nfrom the input prompt proportion of training examples are excluded during our fine-tuning.\n\nWe use a generation temperature of 0.5 and top, = 0.95 as our inference parameter to generate a\nsummarization of each document in the test set. The final output is truncated at 1000 tokens. We\nused the ROUGE-1/ROUGE-2/ROUGE-L scores (Lin, 2004) as the evaluation metrics to evaluate\nthe models‚Äô outputs vs the ground-truth summaries.\n\nIn Table 6 we report our evaluation results. We have also included results from two baselines in\nexisting SCROLLS Leaderboard (Shaham et al., 2022; Ainslie et al., 2023). In general, we have\nobtained competitive R1 score among other models with minimal tuning of hyper-parameters. This\nresult suggests our models with 16384 context window can effectively handle the long document\nsummarization task.\n\n=== END OF FILE ===\n\n'''\n    question = \"Question: What's the title of this paper?\"  # Something from the beginning\n\n    inputs = tokenizer(prompt + question, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\n    print(inputs.input_ids.shape)\n    assert inputs.input_ids.shape[1] > 6200, \"input not long enough\"\n\n    gen_out = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)\n    response = tokenizer.batch_decode(gen_out)[0]\n    response = response.replace(prompt + question, \"\")  # only keep response\n    assert len(response) < 500, \"response must be less than 100 tokens\"\n    print(response)\n    if rope_scaling is None:\n        assert 'Extending Context Window of Large' not in response\n        assert 'Extending Context Window of Large'.upper() not in response\n    else:\n        assert ('Extending Context Window of Large' in response or\n                'Extending Context Window of Large'.upper() in response)\n"}

For other uses, see Eclipse of the Sun (disambiguation).\nTotal solar eclipse\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun's disk, as seen in this 1999 solar eclipse. Solar prominences can be seen along the limb (in red) as well as extensive coronal filaments.\nAnnular solar eclipsePartial solar eclipse\nAn annular solar eclipse (left) occurs when the Moon is too far away to completely cover the Sun's disk (May 20, 2012). During a partial solar eclipse (right), the Moon blocks only part of the Sun's disk (October 25, 2022).\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby obscuring the view of the Sun from a small part of the Earth, totally or partially. Such an alignment occurs approximately every six months, during the eclipse season in its new moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of the Earth's orbit.[1] In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. Unlike a lunar eclipse, which may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth, a solar eclipse can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world. As such, although total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years.\n\nIf the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit and in the same orbital plane as Earth, there would be total solar eclipses once a month, at every new moon. Instead, because the Moon's orbit is tilted at about 5 degrees to Earth's orbit, its shadow usually misses Earth. Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons, resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses each year, no more than two of which can be total.[2][3] Total eclipses are more rare because they require a more precise alignment between the centers of the Sun and Moon, and because the Moon's apparent size in the sky is sometimes too small to fully cover the Sun.\n\nAn eclipse is a natural phenomenon. In some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. Astronomers' predictions of eclipses began in China as early as the 4th century BC; eclipses hundreds of years into the future may now be predicted with high accuracy.\n\nLooking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage, so special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. Only the total phase of a total solar eclipse is safe to view without protection. Enthusiasts known as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles travel to remote locations to see solar eclipses.[4][5]\n\nTypes\n\nPartial and annular phases of the solar eclipse of May 20, 2012\nThere are four types of solar eclipses:\n\nA total eclipse occurs in average every 18 months[Note 1][6] when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible. During any one eclipse, totality occurs at best only in a narrow track on the surface of Earth.[7] This narrow track is called the path of totality.[8]\nAn annular eclipse occurs once every one or two years[6] when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line with the Earth, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.[9]\nA hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse) shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At certain points on the surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare.[9]\nA partial eclipse occurs about twice a year,[6] when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with the Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can be seen only as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface.[9] Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the Sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight.[10]\n\nComparison of minimum and maximum apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon (and planets). An annular eclipse can occur when the Sun has a larger apparent size than the Moon, whereas a total eclipse can occur when the Moon has a larger apparent size.\nThe Sun's distance from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure.[9]\n\nThe Moon's orbit around the Earth is slightly elliptical, as is the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon therefore vary.[11] The magnitude of an eclipse is the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent size of the Sun during an eclipse. An eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth (i.e., near its perigee) can be a total eclipse because the Moon will appear to be large enough to completely cover the Sun's bright disk or photosphere; a total eclipse has a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.000. Conversely, an eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its farthest distance from Earth (i.e., near its apogee) can be only an annular eclipse because the Moon will appear to be slightly smaller than the Sun; the magnitude of an annular eclipse is less than 1.[12]\n\nA hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from less to greater than one, so the eclipse appears to be total at locations nearer the midpoint, and annular at other locations nearer the beginning and end, since the sides of the Earth are slightly further away from the Moon. These eclipses are extremely narrow in their path width and relatively short in their duration at any point compared with fully total eclipses; the 2023 April 20 hybrid eclipse's totality is over a minute in duration at various points along the path of totality. Like a focal point, the width and duration of totality and annularity are near zero at the points where the changes between the two occur.[13]\n\nBecause the Earth's orbit around the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's distance from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, but not as much as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth.[9] When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.[14]\n\nTerminology for central eclipse\n\nEach icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot, representing the Moon (not to scale)\n\nDiamond ring effect at third contact‚Äîthe end of totality‚Äîwith visible prominences\nCentral eclipse is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse.[15] This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse.[15] Gamma is a measure of how centrally the shadow strikes. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.[16]\n\nThe visual phases observed during a total eclipse are called:[17]\n\nFirst contact‚Äîwhen the Moon's limb (edge) is exactly tangential to the Sun's limb.\nSecond contact‚Äîstarting with Baily's Beads (caused by light shining through valleys on the Moon's surface) and the diamond ring effect. Almost the entire disk is covered.\nTotality‚Äîthe Moon obscures the entire disk of the Sun and only the solar corona is visible.\nThird contact‚Äîwhen the first bright light becomes visible and the Moon's shadow is moving away from the observer. Again a diamond ring may be observed.\nFourth contact‚Äîwhen the trailing edge of the Moon ceases to overlap with the solar disk and the eclipse ends.\nPredictions\nGeometry\n\nGeometry of a total solar eclipse (not to scale)\nThe diagrams to the right show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.[18]\n\nThe Moon's orbit around the Earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when a new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.[19]\n\nAs noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's distance from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its distance from the Earth, and it is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.[20][21]\n\n \tMoon\tSun\nAt perigee\n(nearest)\tAt apogee\n(farthest)\tAt perihelion\n(nearest)\tAt aphelion\n(farthest)\nMean radius\t1,737.10 km\n(1,079.38 mi)\t696,000 km\n(432,000 mi)\nDistance\t363,104 km\n(225,622 mi)\t405,696 km\n(252,088 mi)\t147,098,070 km\n(91,402,500 mi)\t152,097,700 km\n(94,509,100 mi)\nAngular\ndiameter[22]\t33' 30\"\n(0.5583¬∞)\t29' 26\"\n(0.4905¬∞)\t32' 42\"\n(0.5450¬∞)\t31' 36\"\n(0.5267¬∞)\nApparent size\nto scale\t\t\t\t\nOrder by\ndecreasing\napparent size\t1st\t4th\t2nd\t3rd\nThe Moon orbits the Earth in approximately 27.3 days, relative to a fixed frame of reference. This is known as the sidereal month. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. This is known as the synodic month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month.[19]\n\nThe Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its ascending node, and vice versa at its descending node.[19] However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due to the action of the Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.[23]\n\nFinally, the Moon's perigee is moving forwards or precessing in its orbit and makes a complete circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the anomalistic month.[24]\n\nThe Moon's orbit intersects with the ecliptic at the two nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and there will always be at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.[25]\n\nEclipses can occur only when the Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is referred to as an eclipse limit, and is given in ranges because the apparent sizes and speeds of the Sun and Moon vary throughout the year. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes.[2] Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.[26][27]\n\n\nFraction of the Sun's disc covered, f, when the same-sized discs are offset a fraction t of their diameter.[28]\nPath\nDuring a central eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, in the case of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also rotating from west to east, at about 28 km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's rotation at about 61 km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west‚Äìeast direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.[29]\n\nThe width of the track of a central eclipse varies according to the relative apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon. In the most favourable circumstances, when a total eclipse occurs very close to perigee, the track can be up to 267 km (166 mi) wide and the duration of totality may be over 7 minutes.[30] Outside of the central track, a partial eclipse is seen over a much larger area of the Earth. Typically, the umbra is 100‚Äì160 km wide, while the penumbral diameter is in excess of 6400 km.[31]\n\nBesselian elements are used to predict whether an eclipse will be partial, annular, or total (or annular/total), and what the eclipse circumstances will be at any given location.[32]:‚ÄäChapter 11‚Ää\n\nCalculations with Besselian elements can determine the exact shape of the umbra's shadow on the Earth's surface. But at what longitudes on the Earth's surface the shadow will fall, is a function of the Earth's rotation, and on how much that rotation has slowed down over time. A number called ŒîT is used in eclipse prediction to take this slowing into account. As the Earth slows, ŒîT increases. ŒîT for dates in the future can only be roughly estimated because the Earth's rotation is slowing irregularly. This means that, although it is possible to predict that there will be a total eclipse on a certain date in the far future, it is not possible to predict in the far future exactly at what longitudes that eclipse will be total. Historical records of eclipses allow estimates of past values of ŒîT and so of the Earth's rotation.

(May 2022)\nThe following factors determine the duration of a total solar eclipse (in order of decreasing importance):[33][34]\n\nThe Moon being almost exactly at perigee (making its angular diameter as large as possible).\nThe Earth being very near aphelion (furthest away from the Sun in its elliptical orbit, making its angular diameter nearly as small as possible).\nThe midpoint of the eclipse being very close to the Earth's equator, where the rotational velocity is greatest and is closest to the speed of the lunar shadow moving over Earth's surface.\nThe vector of the eclipse path at the midpoint of the eclipse aligning with the vector of the Earth's rotation (i.e. not diagonal but due east).\nThe midpoint of the eclipse being near the subsolar point (the part of the Earth closest to the Sun).\nThe longest eclipse that has been calculated thus far is the eclipse of July 16, 2186 (with a maximum duration of 7 minutes 29 seconds over northern Guyana).[33]\n\nOccurrence and cycles\nMain article: Eclipse cycle\n\nAs the Earth revolves around the Sun, approximate axial parallelism of the Moon's orbital plane (tilted five degrees to the Earth's orbital plane) results in the revolution of the lunar nodes relative to the Earth. This causes an eclipse season approximately every six months, in which a solar eclipse can occur at the new moon phase and a lunar eclipse can occur at the full moon phase.\n\nTotal solar eclipse paths: 1001‚Äì2000, showing that total solar eclipses occur almost everywhere on Earth. This image was merged from 50 separate images from NASA.[35]\nTotal solar eclipses are rare events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average,[36] it is estimated that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average.[37] The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700 km/h.[38] Totality currently can never last more than 7 min 32 s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7 min 2 s.[33] The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra.[39] The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7 min 29 s.[33][40] For comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7 min 8 s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there will be no total solar eclipses over 7 min in duration in the 21st century.[41]\n\nIt is possible to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known and one of the most accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120¬∞ in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.[42]\n\nFrequency per year\nBetween two and five solar eclipses occur every year, with at least one per eclipse season. Since the Gregorian calendar was instituted in 1582, years that have had five solar eclipses were 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and 1935. The next occurrence will be 2206.[43] On average, there are about 240 solar eclipses each century.[44]\n\nThe 5 solar eclipses of 1935\nJanuary 5\tFebruary 3\tJune 30\tJuly 30\tDecember 25\nPartial\n(south)\tPartial\n(north)\tPartial\n(north)\tPartial\n(south)\tAnnular\n(south)\n\nSaros 111\t\nSaros 149\t\nSaros 116\t\nSaros 154\t\nSaros 121\nFinal totality\nTotal solar eclipses are seen on Earth because of a fortuitous combination of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds of millions of years in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total or partial, and there were no annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8 cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size.[45] Estimates of the time when the Moon will be unable to occlude the entire Sun when viewed from the Earth range between 650 million[46] and 1.4 billion years in the future.[45]\n\nHistorical eclipses\n\nAstronomers Studying an Eclipse painted by Antoine Caron in 1571\nHistorical eclipses are a very valuable resource for historians, in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced.[47] A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text is important for the chronology of the ancient Near East.[48] There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses. The legendary Chinese king Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago.[49] Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807, BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.[50] The earliest preserved depiction of a partial solar eclipse from 1143 BCE might be the one in tomb KV9 of Ramses V and Ramses VI.[citation needed]\n\n\nRecords of the solar eclipses of 993 and 1004 as well as the lunar eclipses of 1001 and 1002 by Ibn Yunus of Cairo (c. 1005).\nEclipses have been interpreted as omens, or portents.[51] The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse that occurred during a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace as a result of the eclipse.[52] The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor.[53] An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece,[54] which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC.[55] Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC.[56] Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece.[57] The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.[58]\n\nChinese records of eclipses begin at around 720 BC.[59] The 4th century BC astronomer Shi Shen described the prediction of eclipses by using the relative positions of the Moon and Sun.[60]\n\nAttempts have been made to establish the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results,[61][62] and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held at the time of a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. Contemporary chronicles wrote about an eclipse at the beginning of May 664 that coincided with the beginning of the plague of 664 in the British isles.[63] In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before AD 800, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period.[59] The Cairo astronomer Ibn Yunus wrote that the calculation of eclipses was one of the many things that connect astronomy with the Islamic law, because it allowed knowing when a special prayer can be made.[64] The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in AD 968.[56][59]\n\n\nErhard Weigel, predicted course of moon shadow on 12 August 1654 (O.S. 2 August)\nThe first known telescopic observation of a total solar eclipse was made in France in 1706.[59] Nine years later, English astronomer Edmund Halley accurately predicted and observed the solar eclipse of May 3, 1715.[56][59] By the mid-19th century, scientific understanding of the Sun was improving through observations of the Sun's corona during solar eclipses. The corona was identified as part of the Sun's atmosphere in 1842, and the first photograph (or daguerreotype) of a total eclipse was taken of the solar eclipse of July 28, 1851.[56] Spectroscope observations were made of the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, which helped to determine the chemical composition of the Sun.[56] John Fiske summed up myths about the solar eclipse like this in his 1872 book Myth and Myth-Makers,\nthe myth of Hercules and Cacus, the fundamental idea is the victory of the solar god over the robber who steals the light. Now whether the robber carries off the light in the evening when Indra has gone to sleep, or boldly rears his black form against the sky during the daytime, causing darkness to spread over the earth, would make little difference to the framers of the myth. To a chicken a solar eclipse is the same thing as nightfall, and he goes to roost accordingly. Why, then, should the primitive thinker have made a distinction between the darkening of the sky caused by black clouds and that caused by the rotation of the earth? He had no more conception of the scientific explanation of these phenomena than the chicken has of the scientific explanation of an eclipse. For him it was enough to know that the solar radiance was stolen, in the one case as in the other, and to suspect that the same demon was to blame for both robberies.[65]\n\nViewing\n2017 total solar eclipse viewed in real time with audience reactions\nLooking directly at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even for just a few seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.[66][67]\n\nUnder normal conditions, the Sun is so bright that it is difficult to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.[68][69]\n\nPartial and annular eclipses\n\nEclipse glasses filter out eye damaging radiation, allowing direct viewing of the Sun during all partial eclipse phases; they are not used during totality, when the Sun is completely eclipsed\n\nPinhole projection method of observing partial solar eclipse. Insert (upper left): partially eclipsed Sun photographed with a white solar filter. Main image: projections of the partially eclipsed Sun (bottom right)\nViewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses outside the brief period of totality) requires special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters should be used for direct viewing of the Sun's disk.[70] Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.[71][72]\n\nThe safest way to view the Sun's disk is by indirect projection.[73] This can be done by projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1 mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly.[74] A kitchen colander with small holes can also be used to project multiple images of the partially eclipsed Sun onto the ground or a viewing screen. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible.[72] Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one will not be able to see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky. However, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the Sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.[75]\n\nTotality\nSolar eclipse of August 21, 2017\n\nBaily's beads, sunlight visible through lunar valleys\n\nComposite image with corona, prominences, and diamond ring effect\nWhen the shrinking visible part of the photosphere becomes very small, Baily's beads will occur. These are caused by the sunlight still being able to reach the Earth through lunar valleys. Totality then begins with the diamond ring effect, the last bright flash of sunlight.[76]\n\nIt is safe to observe the total phase of a solar eclipse directly only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality.[73] During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and on the opposite side of the Moon.[76]\n\nEclipse chasing\nMain article: Eclipse chasing\nA dedicated group of eclipse chasers have pursued the observation of solar eclipses when they occur around the Earth.[77] A person who chases eclipses is known as an umbraphile, meaning shadow lover.[78] Umbraphiles travel for eclipses and use various tools to help view the sun including solar viewing glasses, also known as eclipse glasses, as well as telescopes.[79][80]\n\nPhotography\n\nThe progression of a solar eclipse on August 1, 2008 in Novosibirsk, Russia. All times UTC (local time was UTC+7). The time span between shots is three minutes.\nPhotographing an eclipse is possible with fairly common camera equipment. In order for the disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200 mm for a 35 mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500 mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended.[81] Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.[82]\n\nOther observations\nA total solar eclipse provides a rare opportunity to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.[83]\n\n\nPinholes in shadows during no eclipse (1‚Ää&‚Ää4), a partial eclipse (2‚Ää&‚Ää5) and an annular eclipse (3‚Ää&‚Ää6)\nAs the light filters through leaves of trees during a partial eclipse, the overlapping leaves create natural pinholes, displaying mini eclipses on the ground.[84]\n\nPhenomena associated with eclipses include shadow bands (also known as flying shadows), which are similar to shadows on the bottom of a swimming pool. They occur only just prior to and after totality, when a narrow solar crescent acts as an anisotropic light source.[85]\n\n1919 observations\nSee also: Tests of general relativity ¬ß Deflection of light by the Sun\n\nEddington's original photograph of the 1919 eclipse, which provided evidence for Einstein's theory of general relativity.\nThe observation of a total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus, with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed.[86] The observation with the Sun between the stars was possible only during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.[87][88]\n\nGravity anomalies\nThere is a long history of observations of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially during the period of totality. In 1954, and again in 1959, Maurice Allais reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses.[89] The reality of this phenomenon, named the Allais effect, has remained controversial. Similarly, in 1970, Saxl and Allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum; this phenomenon is called the Saxl effect.[90]\n\nObservation during the 1997 solar eclipse by Wang et al. suggested a possible gravitational shielding effect,[91] which generated debate. In 2002, Wang and a collaborator published detailed data analysis, which suggested that the phenomenon still remains unexplained.[92]\n\nEclipses and transits\nIn principle, the simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of a planet is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.[93]\n\nMore common, but still infrequent, is a conjunction of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) at the time of a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized that there may be a planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.[94]\n\nArtificial satellites\n\nThe Moon's shadow over Turkey and Cyprus, seen from the ISS during a 2006 total solar eclipse.\n\nA composite image showing the ISS transit of the Sun while the 2017 solar eclipse was in progress.\nArtificial satellites can also pass in front of the Sun as seen from the Earth, but none is large enough to cause an eclipse. At the altitude of the International Space Station, for example, an object would need to be about 3.35 km (2.08 mi) across to blot the Sun out entirely. These transits are difficult to watch because the zone of visibility is very small. The satellite passes over the face of the Sun in about a second, typically. As with a transit of a planet, it will not get dark.[95]\n\nObservations of eclipses from spacecraft or artificial satellites orbiting above the Earth's atmosphere are not subject to weather conditions. The crew of Gemini 12 observed a total solar eclipse from space in 1966.[96] The partial phase of the 1999 total eclipse was visible from Mir.[97]\n\nImpact\nThe solar eclipse of March 20, 2015, was the first occurrence of an eclipse estimated to potentially have a significant impact on the power system, with the electricity sector taking measures to mitigate any impact. The continental Europe and Great Britain synchronous areas were estimated to have about 90 gigawatts of solar power and it was estimated that production would temporarily decrease by up to 34 GW compared to a clear sky day.[98][99]\n\nEclipses may cause the temperature to decrease by 3 ¬∞C, with wind power potentially decreasing as winds are reduced by 0.7 m/s.[100]\n\nIn addition to the drop in light level and air temperature, animals change their behavior during totality. For example, birds and squirrels return to their nests and crickets chirp.[101]\n\nRecent and forthcoming solar eclipses\nMain article: List of solar eclipses in the 21st century\nFurther information: Lists of solar eclipses\n\nEclipse path for total and hybrid eclipses from 2021 to 2040.\nEclipses occur only in the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the ascending or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is a little less than half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the Earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the Earth and the series ends.[26] Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active.[citation needed]\n\n1997‚Äì2000\nThis eclipse is a member of a semester series.

For the song, see Solar Eclipse (song).\n\"Eclipse of the Sun\" redirects here. For other uses, see Eclipse of the Sun (disambiguation).\nTotal solar eclipse\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun's disk, as seen in this solar eclipse. Solar prominences can be seen along the limb (in red) as well as extensively the coronal and partly the radiating coronal streamers.\nAnnular solar eclipse\nAn annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is too far away to completely cover the Sun's disk (October 14, 2023).\nPartial solar eclipse\nDuring a partial solar eclipse, the Moon blocks only part of the Sun's disk (October 25, 2022).\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby obscuring the view of the Sun from a small part of Earth, totally or partially. Such an alignment occurs approximately every six months, during the eclipse season in its new moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of Earth's orbit.[1] In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. Unlike a lunar eclipse, which may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth, a solar eclipse can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world. As such, although total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years.\n\nIf the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit and in the same orbital plane as Earth, there would be total solar eclipses once a month, at every new moon. Instead, because the Moon's orbit is tilted at about 5 degrees to Earth's orbit, its shadow usually misses Earth. Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons, resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses each year, no more than two of which can be total.[2][3] Total eclipses are rarer because they require a more precise alignment between the centers of the Sun and Moon, and because the Moon's apparent size in the sky is sometimes too small to fully cover the Sun.\n\nAn eclipse is a natural phenomenon. In some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. Astronomers' predictions of eclipses began in China as early as the 4th century BC; eclipses hundreds of years into the future may now be predicted with high accuracy.\n\nLooking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage, so special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. Only the total phase of a total solar eclipse is safe to view without protection. Enthusiasts known as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles travel to remote locations to see solar eclipses.[4][5]\n\nTypes\nTen Minute Time Lapse Video of the Total Solar Eclipse on April 8, 2024, in Mazatl√°n, Mexico.\n\nPartial and annular phases of the solar eclipse of May 20, 2012\nThe Sun's distance from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure.[6]\n\nThe Moon's orbit around Earth is slightly elliptical, as is Earth's orbit around the Sun. The apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon therefore vary.[7] The magnitude of an eclipse is the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent size of the Sun during an eclipse. An eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth (i.e., near its perigee) can be a total eclipse because the Moon will appear to be large enough to completely cover the Sun's bright disk or photosphere; a total eclipse has a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.000. Conversely, an eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its farthest distance from Earth (i.e., near its apogee) can be only an annular eclipse because the Moon will appear to be slightly smaller than the Sun; the magnitude of an annular eclipse is less than 1.[8]\n\nBecause Earth's orbit around the Sun is also elliptical, Earth's distance from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, but not as much as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth.[6] When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.[9]\n\nThere are three main types of solar eclipses:[10]\n\nTotal eclipse\nA total eclipse occurs on average every 18 months[11] when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible. During an eclipse, totality occurs only along a narrow track on the surface of Earth.[12] This narrow track is called the path of totality.[13]\n\nAnnular eclipse\nAn annular eclipse, like a total eclipse, occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line with Earth. During an annular eclipse, however, the apparent size of the Moon is not large enough to completely block out the Sun.[6] Totality thus does not occur; the Sun instead appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.[6] Annular eclipses occur once every one or two years, not annually.[11][14] Their name comes from the Latin root word anulus, meaning \"ring\", rather than annus, for \"year\".[14]\n\nPartial eclipse\nA partial eclipse occurs about twice a year,[11] when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can be seen only as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above Earth's polar regions and never intersects Earth's surface.[6] Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the Sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight.[15]\n\n\nComparison of minimum and maximum apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon (and planets). An annular eclipse can occur when the Sun has a larger apparent size than the Moon, whereas a total eclipse can occur when the Moon has a larger apparent size.\nTerminology\nHybrid eclipse\nA hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse) shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At certain points on the surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare.[6]\n\nA hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from less to greater than one, so the eclipse appears to be total at locations nearer the midpoint, and annular at other locations nearer the beginning and end, since the sides of Earth are slightly further away from the Moon. These eclipses are extremely narrow in their path width and relatively short in their duration at any point compared with fully total eclipses; the 2023 April 20 hybrid eclipse's totality is over a minute in duration at various points along the path of totality. Like a focal point, the width and duration of totality and annularity are near zero at the points where the changes between the two occur.[16]\n\nCentral eclipse\n\nEach icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot, representing the Moon (not to scale)\n\nDiamond ring effect at third contact‚Äîthe end of totality‚Äîwith visible prominences (August 21, 2017)\nCentral eclipse is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse.[17] This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse.[17] Gamma is a measure of how centrally the shadow strikes. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.[18]\n\nEclipse phases\nThe visual phases observed during a total eclipse are called:[19]\n\nFirst contact‚Äîwhen the Moon's limb (edge) is exactly tangential to the Sun's limb.\nSecond contact‚Äîstarting with Baily's Beads (caused by light shining through valleys on the Moon's surface) and the diamond ring effect. Almost the entire disk is covered.\nTotality‚Äîthe Moon obscures the entire disk of the Sun and only the solar corona is visible.\nThird contact‚Äîwhen the first bright light becomes visible and the Moon's shadow is moving away from the observer. Again a diamond ring may be observed.\nFourth contact‚Äîwhen the trailing edge of the Moon ceases to overlap with the solar disk and the eclipse ends.\nPredictions\nGeometry\n\nGeometry of a total solar eclipse (not to scale)\nThe diagrams to the right show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.[20]\n\nThe Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when a new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.[21]\n\nAs noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's distance from Earth varies by up to about 5.9% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its distance from Earth, and it is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect (by up to about 0.85% from its average value). On average, the Moon appears to be slightly (2.1%) smaller than the Sun as seen from Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.[22][23]\n\nMoon    Sun\nAt perigee\n(nearest)       At apogee\n(farthest)      At perihelion\n(nearest)       At aphelion\n(farthest)\nMean radius     1737.10 km\n(1079.38 mi)    696000 km\n(432000 mi)\nDistance        363104 km\n(225622 mi)     405696 km\n(252088 mi)     147098070 km\n(91402500 mi)   152097700 km\n(94509100 mi)\nAngular\ndiameter[24]    33' 30\"\n(0.5583¬∞)       29' 26\"\n(0.4905¬∞)       32' 42\"\n(0.5450¬∞)       31' 36\"\n(0.5267¬∞)\nApparent size\nto scale                                \nOrder by\ndecreasing\napparent size   1st     4th     2nd     3rd\nThe Moon orbits Earth in approximately 27.3 days, relative to a fixed frame of reference. This is known as the sidereal month. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. This is known as the synodic month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month.[21]\n\nThe Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its ascending node, and vice versa at its descending node.[21] However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due to the action of the Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.[25]\n\nFinally, the Moon's perigee is moving forwards or precessing in its orbit and makes a complete circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the anomalistic month.[26]\n\nThe Moon's orbit intersects with the ecliptic at the two nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and there will always be at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.[27]\n\nEclipses can occur only when the Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is referred to as an eclipse limit, and is given in ranges because the apparent sizes and speeds of the Sun and Moon vary throughout the year. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes.[2] Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.[28][29]\n\n\nFraction of the Sun's disc covered, f, when the same-sized discs are offset a fraction t of their diameter.[30]\nPath\n\nFrom space, the Moon's shadow during the solar eclipse of March 9, 2016 appears as a dark spot moving across Earth.\nDuring a central eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, in the case of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across Earth. Earth is also rotating from west to east, at about 28 km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as Earth's rotation at about 61 km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west‚Äìeast direction across a map of Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus Earth's rotational velocity.[31]\n\nThe width of the track of a central eclipse varies according to the relative apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon. In the most favourable circumstances, when a total eclipse occurs very close to perigee, the track can be up to 267 km (166 mi) wide and the duration of totality may be over 7 minutes.[32] Outside of the central track, a partial eclipse is seen over a much larger area of Earth. Typically, the umbra is 100‚Äì160 km wide, while the penumbral diameter is in excess of 6400 km.[33]\n\nBesselian elements are used to predict whether an eclipse will be partial, annular, or total (or annular/total), and what the eclipse circumstances will be at any given location.[34]:‚ÄäChapter 11‚Ää\n\nCalculations with Besselian elements can determine the exact shape of the umbra's shadow on Earth's surface. But at what longitudes on Earth's surface the shadow will fall, is a function of Earth's rotation, and on how much that rotation has slowed down over time. A number called ŒîT is used in eclipse prediction to take this slowing into account. As Earth slows, ŒîT increases. ŒîT for dates in the future can only be roughly estimated because Earth's rotation is slowing irregularly. This means that, although it is possible to predict that there will be a total eclipse on a certain date in the far future, it is not possible to predict in the far future exactly at what longitudes that eclipse will be total. Historical records of eclipses allow estimates of past values of ŒîT and so of Earth's rotation. [34]:‚ÄäEquation 11.132‚Ää\n\nDuration\nThe following factors determine the duration of a total solar eclipse (in order of decreasing importance):[35][36]\n\nThe Moon being almost exactly at perigee (making its angular diameter as large as possible).\nEarth being very near aphelion (furthest away from the Sun in its elliptical orbit, making its angular diameter nearly as small as possible).\nThe midpoint of the eclipse being very close to Earth's equator, where the rotational velocity is greatest and is closest to the speed of the lunar shadow moving over Earth's surface.\nThe vector of the eclipse path at the midpoint of the eclipse aligning with the vector of Earth's rotation (i.e. not diagonal but due east).\nThe midpoint of the eclipse being near the subsolar point (the part of Earth closest to the Sun).\nThe longest eclipse that has been calculated thus far is the eclipse of July 16, 2186 (with a maximum duration of 7 minutes 29 seconds over northern Guyana).[35]\n\nOccurrence and cycles\nMain article: Eclipse cycle\n\nAs Earth revolves around the Sun, approximate axial parallelism of the Moon's orbital plane (tilted five degrees to Earth's orbital plane) results in the revolution of the lunar nodes relative to Earth. This causes an eclipse season approximately every six months, in which a solar eclipse can occur at the new moon phase and a lunar eclipse can occur at the full moon phase.\n\nTotal solar eclipse paths: 1001‚Äì2000, showing that total solar eclipses occur almost everywhere on Earth. This image was merged from 50 separate images from NASA.[37]\nA total solar eclipse is a rare event, recurring somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average,[38] yet is estimated to recur at any given location only every 360‚Äì410 years on average.[39] The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700 km/h (1100 mph; 470 m/s; 1500 ft/s).[40] Totality currently can never last more than 7 min 32 s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7 min 2 s.[35] The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra.[41] The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7 min 29 s.[35][42] For comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7 min 8 s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there will be no total solar eclipses over 7 min in duration in the 21st century.[43]\n\nIt is possible to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known and one of the most accurate. A saros lasts 6585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120¬∞ in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.[44]\n\nFrequency per year\nBetween two and five solar eclipses occur every year, with at least one per eclipse season. Since the Gregorian calendar was instituted in 1582, years that have had five solar eclipses were 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and 1935. The next occurrence will be 2206.[45] On average, there are about 240 solar eclipses each century.[46]\n\nThe five solar eclipses of 1935\nJanuary 5       February 3      June 30 July 30 December 25\nPartial\n(south) Partial\n(north) Partial\n(north) Partial\n(south) Annular\n(south)\n\nSaros 111       \nSaros 149       \nSaros 116       \nSaros 154       \nSaros 121\nFinal totality\nTotal solar eclipses are seen on Earth because of a fortuitous combination of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds of millions of years in the past, the Moon was closer to Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total or partial, and there were no annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around Earth becomes approximately 3.8 cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size.[47] Estimates of the time when the Moon will be unable to occlude the entire Sun when viewed from Earth range between 650 million[48] and 1.4 billion years in the future.[47]\n\nViewing\n2017 total solar eclipse viewed in real time with audience reactions\nLooking directly at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even for just a few seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.[49][50]\n\nUnder normal conditions, the Sun is so bright that it is difficult to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.[51][52]\n\nPartial and annular eclipses\n\nEclipse glasses filter out eye damaging radiation, allowing direct viewing of the Sun during all partial eclipse phases; they are not used during totality, when the Sun is completely eclipsed\n\nPinhole projection method of observing partial solar eclipse. Insert (upper left): partially eclipsed Sun photographed with a white solar filter. Main image: projections of the partially eclipsed Sun (bottom right)\nViewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses outside the brief period of totality) requires special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters should be used for direct viewing of the Sun's disk.[53] Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.[54][55]\n\nThe safest way to view the Sun's disk is by indirect projection.[56] This can be done by projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1 mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly.[57] A kitchen colander with small holes can also be used to project multiple images of the partially eclipsed Sun onto the ground or a viewing screen. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible.[55] Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one will not be able to see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky. However, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the Sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.[58]\n\nTotality\nSolar eclipse of August 21, 2017\n\nBaily's beads, sunlight visible through lunar valleys\n\nComposite image with corona, prominences, and diamond ring effect\nWhen the shrinking visible part of the photosphere becomes very small, Baily's beads will occur. These are caused by the sunlight still being able to reach Earth through lunar valleys. Totality then begins with the diamond ring effect, the last bright flash of sunlight.[59]\n\nIt is safe to observe the total phase of a solar eclipse directly only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality.[56] During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, coronal streamers and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and on the opposite side of the Moon.[59]\n\nEclipse chasing\nMain article: Eclipse chasing\nA dedicated group of eclipse chasers have pursued the observation of solar eclipses when they occur around Earth.[60] A person who chases eclipses is known as an umbraphile, meaning shadow lover.[61] Umbraphiles travel for eclipses and use various tools to help view the sun including solar viewing glasses, also known as eclipse glasses, as well as telescopes.[62][63]\n\nPhotography\n\nThe progression of a solar eclipse on August 1, 2008 in Novosibirsk, Russia. All times UTC (local time was UTC+7). The time span between shots is three minutes.\nThe first known photograph of a solar eclipse was taken on July 28, 1851, by Johann Julius Friedrich Berkowski, using the daguerreotype process.[64][65]\n\nPhotographing an eclipse is possible with fairly common camera equipment. In order for the disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200 mm for a 35 mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500 mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended.[66] Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.[67]\n\n\nPinholes in shadows during no eclipse (1‚Ää&‚Ää4), a partial eclipse (2‚Ää&‚Ää5) and an annular eclipse (3‚Ää&‚Ää6)\n\nPinhole shadows during the Solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, as seen from Winder, Georgia.\nHistorical eclipses\nFurther information: Eclipses in mythology and culture and Lists of solar eclipses\n\nAstronomers Studying an Eclipse, Antoine Caron, 1571\nHistorical eclipses are a very valuable resource for historians, in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced.[68] The oldest recorded solar eclipse was recorded on a clay tablet found at Ugarit, in modern Syria, with two plausible dates usually cited: 3 May 1375 BC or 5 March 1223 BC, the latter being favored by most recent authors on the topic.[69][70] A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text is important for the chronology of the ancient Near East.[71] There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses. The legendary Chinese king Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4000 years ago.[72] Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807, BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.[73]\n\n\nRecords of the solar eclipses of 993 and 1004 as well as the lunar eclipses of 1001 and 1002 by Ibn Yunus of Cairo (c. 1005).\nEclipses have been interpreted as omens, or portents.[74] The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse that occurred during a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace as a result of the eclipse.[75] The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor.[76] An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece,[77] which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC.[78] Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC.[79] Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece.[80] The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.[81]\n\nIn ancient China, where solar eclipses were known as an \"eating of the Sun\" (r√¨sh√≠ Êó•È£ü), the earliest records of eclipses date to around 720 BC.[82] The 4th century BC astronomer Shi Shen described the prediction of eclipses by using the relative positions of the Moon and Sun.[83]\n\nAttempts have been made to establish the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results,[84][85] and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held at the time of a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. Contemporary chronicles wrote about an eclipse at the beginning of May 664 that coincided with the beginning of the plague of 664 in the British isles.[86] In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before AD 800, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period.[82]\n\nA solar eclipse took place on January 27, 632 over Arabia during Muhammad's lifetime. Muhammad denied the eclipse had anything to do with his son dying earlier that day, saying \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death of someone from the people but they are two signs amongst the signs of God.\"[87] The Cairo astronomer Ibn Yunus wrote that the calculation of eclipses was one of the many things that connect astronomy with the Islamic law, because it allowed knowing when a special prayer can be made.[88] The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in AD 968.[79][82]\n\n\nErhard Weigel, predicted course of Moon shadow on 12 August 1654 (O.S. 2 August)\nThe first known telescopic observation of a total solar eclipse was made in France in 1706.[82] Nine years later, English astronomer Edmund Halley accurately predicted and observed the solar eclipse of May 3, 1715.[79][82] By the mid-19th century, scientific understanding of the Sun was improving through observations of the Sun's corona during solar eclipses. The corona was identified as part of the Sun's atmosphere in 1842, and the first photograph (or daguerreotype) of a total eclipse was taken of the solar eclipse of July 28, 1851.[79] Spectroscope observations were made of the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, which helped to determine the chemical composition of the Sun.[79]\n\nJohn Fiske summed up myths about the solar eclipse like this in his 1872 book Myth and Myth-Makers,\nthe myth of Hercules and Cacus, the fundamental idea is the victory of the solar god over the robber who steals the light. Now whether the robber carries off the light in the evening when Indra has gone to sleep, or boldly rears his black form against the sky during the daytime, causing darkness to spread over the earth, would make little difference to the framers of the myth. To a chicken a solar eclipse is the same thing as nightfall, and he goes to roost accordingly. Why, then, should the primitive thinker have made a distinction between the darkening of the sky caused by black clouds and that caused by the rotation of the earth? He had no more conception of the scientific explanation of these phenomena than the chicken has of the scientific explanation of an eclipse. For him it was enough to know that the solar radiance was stolen, in the one case as in the other, and to suspect that the same demon was to blame for both robberies.[89]\n\nParticular observations, phenomena and impact\n\nSolar eclipse with the still illuminated and refrecting horizon, as well as the coronal streamers,\nA total solar eclipse provides a rare opportunity to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.[90]\n\nPhenomena associated with eclipses include shadow bands (also known as flying shadows), which are similar to shadows on the bottom of a swimming pool. They occur only just prior to and after totality, when a narrow solar crescent acts as an anisotropic light source.[91] As the light filters through leaves of trees during a partial eclipse, the overlapping leaves create natural pinholes, displaying mini eclipses on the ground.[92]\n\n1919 observations\nSee also: Tests of general relativity ¬ß Deflection of light by the Sun\n\nEddington's original photograph of the 1919 eclipse, which provided evidence for Einstein's theory of general relativity.\nThe observation of a total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus, with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed.[93] The observation with the Sun between the stars was possible only during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.[94][95]\n\nGravity anomalies\nThere is a long history of observations of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially during the period of totality. In 1954, and again in 1959, Maurice Allais reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses.[96] The reality of this phenomenon, named the Allais effect, has remained controversial. Similarly, in 1970, Saxl and Allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum; this phenomenon is called the Saxl effect.[97]\n\nObservation during the 1997 solar eclipse by Wang et al. suggested a possible gravitational shielding effect,[98] which generated debate. In 2002, Wang and a collaborator published detailed data analysis, which suggested that the phenomenon still remains unexplained.[99]\n\nEclipses and transits\nIn principle, the simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of a planet is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.[100]\n\nMore common, but still infrequent, is a conjunction of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) at the time of a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized that there may be a planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.[101]\n\nArtificial satellites\n\nThe Moon's shadow over Turkey and Cyprus, seen from the ISS during a 2006 total solar eclipse.\n\nA composite image showing the ISS transit of the Sun while the 2017 solar eclipse was in progress\nArtificial satellites can also pass in front of the Sun as seen from Earth, but none is large enough to cause an eclipse. At the altitude of the International Space Station, for example, an object would need to be about 3.35 km (2.08 mi) across to blot the Sun out entirely. These transits are difficult to watch because the zone of visibility is very small. The satellite passes over the face of the Sun in about a second, typically. As with a transit of a planet, it will not get dark.[102]\n\nObservations of eclipses from spacecraft or artificial satellites orbiting above Earth's atmosphere are not subject to weather conditions. The crew of Gemini 12 observed a total solar eclipse from space in 1966.[103] The partial phase of the 1999 total eclipse was visible from Mir.[104]\n\nImpact\nThe solar eclipse of March 20, 2015, was the first occurrence of an eclipse estimated to potentially have a significant impact on the power system, with the electricity sector taking measures to mitigate any impact. The continental Europe and Great Britain synchronous areas were estimated to have about 90 gigawatts of solar power and it was estimated that production would temporarily decrease by up to 34 GW compared to a clear sky day.[105][106]\n\nEclipses may cause the temperature to decrease by 3 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F), with wind power potentially decreasing as winds are reduced by 0.7 meters (2.3 ft) per second.[107]\n\nIn addition to the drop in light level and air temperature, animals change their behavior during totality. For example, birds and squirrels return to their nests and crickets chirp.[108]\n\nRecent and forthcoming solar eclipses\nMain article: List of solar eclipses in the 21st century\nFurther information: Lists of solar eclipses\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is a little less than half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat.

You have to admit that this is wrong. I think especially for mathematicians to come in and see an environment where there's guiding ideas that people haven't really worked out, and a lot of things are known, do not work for known reasons. But people are still acting as if this is not true and trying to figure out how to do something and make career for themselves. Peter Wojt is a theoretical physicist and a mathematician at Columbia University. He's been an influential figure in the ongoing debates surrounding string theory. His critiques, as articulated in his book, Not Even Wrong, strike at the heart of many popular assertions about this framework. Professor Hoyt also has a widely read blog in the math and physics scene called Not Even Wrong, so it's the same name. And the links to all resources everything mentioned will be in the description as usual. take meticulous time stamps and we take meticulous show notes in one sense the problem with string theory is the opposite of the problem of fossil fuels with fossil fuel companies You have a goal let's say it's to wash your clothes and you're able to achieve that goal but you produce negative externalities where a string theory has plenty of positive externalities but arguably achieves little toward its initial goal Professor White introduces a novel tow approach called Euclidean Twister unification. You may recognize that term Twister, as it's primarily associated with Roger Penrose. Twisters provide an alternative to spacetime descriptions in quantum physics. Peter's application of Twisters is in the Euclidean setting, and he talks about how this significantly changes the playing field. It opens up a connection between gravity and the weak interaction, because space-time in this formulation is inherently Cairo. We also talk about spinners and Michael Atiyah. You know how some people are Christian mystics or Muslim mystics? Well, Atiyah seems to be a spinner mystic. We alternate between technical and more intuitive discourse. If you're new to the theories of everything channel, this is par for the course, and my name is Kurt Jai Mungle. Usually what we do is we interweave between rigorous, steep technicality, and then periods of explaining the intuition behind what was just said. In other words, you can think of it as high intensity interval training for the mind. Recall the system here on Toe, which is if you have a question for any of the guests, whether this guest or from a different Toll podcast, you can leave a comment on that podcast with the word query and a colon. This way, when I'm searching for the next part with this guest, I can press Control F, easily finding it in the YouTube studio backend. Further, if I'm able to pose your query, I'll cite your name verbally, either aloud or in the description. Welcome and enjoy this episode with Peter White. Welcome, Professor. Thank you so much. It's an honor to have you. I've been wanting to speak to you for almost two years since you came out with Euclidean Twister Theory or Euclidean Unification Theory. And while here you are. Well, thanks. Thanks for having me on. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to kind of be able to talk about some of these topics. And I've certainly enjoyed some of your other programs. And the one with my friend Edward Frankel recently was really spectacular. Thank you. Yeah, that's all due to Ed, of course. Okay. What are you working on these days? What's your research interests? Yeah, so there's something very specific. I'm just in the middle of trying to finish a short paper about an idea, which I'm not quite sure what they're... I guess I've for now entitled, the draft of the paper is titled Space Time is Right-Handed. And there's a slight danger that I'll change conventions. It'll end up being that slight space time is left-handed, but I think it will stay right-handed. And that's related to the twister stuff that I've been working on for the last few years, which I'm still quite excited about. But there's something at the, there's one kind of basic claim at the bottom of what I'm trying to do with the twisters, which is, I think to the standard way of thinking about particle physics and general relativity and spinners, it's initially not very plausible. I should say one reason that I actually didn't, it took me a long time to get back to the Euclian twister stuff from some early ideas years ago was that I didn't actually believe that this basic thing that I needed to happen and could happen. And I think lots of other people have had the same problem with this. And the more I looked into the twister stuff, the more I became convinced that something like this had to work out. But more recently, the last few months, I've come up with an understanding in much simpler terms, not involving twisters, just involving spinners, about the really unusual thing that's going on here. And I think that, you know, I've been trying to write up kind of an explanation of the basic idea. And I think it's a fairly simple one. And as I've been writing it up, I keep thinking, well, wait a minute, can this really work? There's no way this can actually really work. But the more I've been thinking about it, the more I've been convinced, yes, this actually does really work. So I'm hoping within the next few days to have a final version of that paper, well, not a final version of that paper I can at least send around to people and try to get comments on and also read about it and publicly on my blog. I read the paper. Thank you for sending you. Yeah, what you have is a very, it was a very early draft of it, which made even less, hopefully the, I'll have something that will make more sense will be what the public will see, but we'll see. Yeah. Do you think spinners are more simplified or easy to understand the twisters? Oh, yeah, yeah. So spinners are really very basic, very, very basic things. I mean, every elementary particle like electrons are the way you describe them. They're spinners. They're going to have nature as spinners. You have to electron wave functions are spinners. And so they're in every, you know, every physics every if you do quantum mechanics or do quantum field theory you have to spend a fair amount of times at spinners so spinners are very very basic things and they're not um i spent a lot of my career kind of thinking about them trying to better understand them and i keep learning new things and it's in the last few months i kind of i something about them, which I think is new, at least I've never seen before. And this is what I'm trying to write about it. But they're very fine metal objects. It's a little bit hard to, anyway, I can give you a whole lecture on spinners. I'm not sure how much of that you want or where you want to start with that. Right. Well, there's one view that we can understand them in quotes algebraically, but that doesn't mean we understand what spinners are. So that's the Michael Latia approach where he says it's like the letter I, the complex eye, the imaginary I, back in the 1400s or 1500s. It's only now or a couple hundred years later, you realize what they are. And so sure, we have many different ways of describing spinners mathematically, but it's still a mystery as to what they are. So do you feel like, no, we understand what they are, or there's much more to be understood more than the formalism? Well, yeah, it's very interesting. You bring up Atia, yeah. So Atia at various points, did make this argument that there's something very interesting in which we don't understand going on of the spinners and that yeah he i think was thinking of it in a much more general context spinners you know are really if you try and do geometry of any kind um or reminding in geometry you re expressing everything in terms of spinners instead of in terms of vectors and tensors gives you a very different, in some ways, more powerful formalism, but one that people are not that used to. And it has some amazing properties. It's kind of deeply related to notions about topology and K-theory and the Daraq operator gets into it. So the thing that made attia you know really most famous his index there was singer you know this is that it's basically saying you know you can compete everything comes down to a certain kind of fundamental case and that is the final case of the drach operator and spinners so he was seeing spinners kind of at the, you know, as this really kind of central thing to the most important thing that he'd worked on. And so there's a lot to say. So there's a lot known about spinners, but there's also a lot, it's a little bit mysterious where they come from. I think the new stuff that I've been more, so I've been thinking about that a lot over the years, but the new stuff that has gotten, where I think there's something new that I see going on is not the general story about spinners, but a very, very specific story about spinners in four dimensions. So you have spinners in any dimension. Any dimension, you can write down spinners and they're useful. But in four dimensions, some very, very special things happen. And the other very, very special thing, it's interesting thing that's going on in four dimensions is that from the point of view of physics, there's two different signatures that you're interested in. You're interested in either spinners in the usual kind of four dimensions where all four dimensions are the same and you're just trying to do Euclidean geometry in four dimensions, which I might sometimes call Euclidean spinners, or you're interested in spinners of the sort that you actually observe in a relativistic quantum field theories where the geometry is that of Minkowski space. So sometimes we refer those as Minkowski spinners. And so you have two different versions of four dimensions, one with a totally positive signature and one where one direction has the opposite sign than the others in the metric. So you have to treat time differently than space, and that's Minkowski space. So there's two different things than the general story that I'm interested in here. One is very specific, what has specifically the geometry of four dimensions, and the other is very specifically the relation between Euclidean and Minkowski signature spinners. So is it your understanding or your proposal that the world is actually Euclidean, and it's been a mistake to do physics in a Minkowski way? When we wick rotate, we see that as a mathematical trick. And you're saying, no, no, no, that's actually the real space. That's the real, quote unquote, even though there's something imaginary about it. And the Minkowski case was the mistake. Like, an analogy would be, we operate in U.S. USD. And then for some calculations, it's easier to go into yen. And we think that the actual world is operating in the United States, and the calculations are just something to make the numbers easier. And then you're saying, no, no, no, what's really happening is in Japan, and it's been a mistake to go into the USDA, or the USD is just to make the math easier. So is that what you're saying or no? Well, so this goes back more to the Euclidean twister stuff. Yeah. So there, well, yeah, it's been well known in physics that you really kind of, that the problem in there's a problem with Minkowski space time. If you try and write down your theory in Mkowski space time, you, the simplest story about how a free particle evolves, you write down the formulas for what's a free particle going to do, what's its propagator, and you see that it's just ill-defined. There is no, you know, you've written down a formula which mathematically is ill-defined. It needs more information in order to actually be a well-defined formula. And I mean, technically, if you look at any physics book, you'll see they're saying, well, you know, we're going to do, the answer is this integral, and you look at this integral, and this integral is going straight through two poles, poles, and that's just ambiguous. You don't know how to define such an ambiguities about how you define such an rules. So the one, the aspect, you've always known you have to do something like with rotation. You have to do something. You have to get rid of those ambiguities. And one way of getting rid of those ambiguities is, you know, analytically continuing and making time a complex variable, analytically continuing it, analytically continuing maybe to Euclidean signature, and there the formulas are well defined. So it's, yeah, I'm not sure, I'm very comfortable saying one of these is real and one of these is not. It's the same, it's the same formula. It's just you have to realize that to make sense of it, you have to kind of go into the complex plane in time. And you can, if you things are analytic, if this is a holomorphic function in time, you can either evaluate what happens at imaginary time or you can make time real, but you have to take the limit in a certain way, moving, like perhaps starting with imaginary time and then moving analytically continuing a certain direction to get real time. But that's the standard story. That's not me saying this. That's a standard story. Right. And then there's a, how do you, what sense do you make of this? Is this just a mathematical truck, which a lot of physicists will say, well, that's just some kind of weird mathematical trick. It's not, has nothing to the reality. Or do you take this more seriously? So what's always fascinated me is more is that it's fairly clear what's going on if you just talk about scalar fields. If you talk about particles with spin zero or fields that transform trivially under rotations, you know, what happens when you go to imaginary time is, you know, it's quite interesting and in some ways tricky, but it's very well understood. But it's never actually been very well understood. What happens when you have spinner fields? And this is the problem is that these spinners in Euclidean signature and spinners in a calcium signature are quite different things. And so you can't just say, oh, I'm going to analytically continue from one to the other because they're not related. Anyway, it's very unclear how you're going to do that. And so there's also a similar story in Twister theory. You can do Twister Theory, Yonkowski Space Time, which is what Penrose and his collaborators mostly did. Or you can do it in Euclidean signature space time, which is what Atia and a lot of other people and mathematicians have done. And in principle, the two are related by analytic continuation. But the way that works is quite, you know, I think it's much subtler than you expect. And so what I've been interested in, you know, most recently this business about, it really is a claim that the standard way of thinking about how you analytically continue between these two different kinds of spinners is you're making kind of a wrong choice when you do that. And there's a good reason for the standard choice you're making when you normally when you do that. But there is actually another choice you can make, which is that instead of working with spinners which are kind of symmetric, there's two different kinds, which by convention you can call right and left-handed or positive and negative chirality. And the standard setup treats this question, you know, symmetrically, but between the plus and minus, the chirality is between right and left spinners. But it's, what I've kind of realized recently is it looks like it's quite possible to make this setup completely asymmetric so that you just describe spinners using these right-handed or positive chirality spinners. You just don't use the left-handed ones at all in your construction of space time. You can do that. It appears to be, and that's why this paper is called space time is right-handed. Is it the case that you could have called it space-time as chiral, and you could have equivalently described as left-handed, or is there something specific about right-handedness? No, yeah, yeah. It's certainly, it's a matter of convention, which, but you base have but you basically, to say it a little bit more technically, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, if you're, is this group called SL2C, it's two by two complex matrices, a determinant one. Um, and what you realize is when you, if you work, if you come, if you work in complex version of four dimensions, the symmetry group is two copies of SL2C. And you can call it a plus copy and a minus copy or you can call it a right copy and a left copy, but there's two of them. And the standard convention in order to get analytic continuation to work out the way people expected has been to say that the physical Lorentz group that corresponds to our real world is not chiral asymmetric. It's kind of a diagonal, which is you use both the right and left. And you have to complex conjugate when you go from one side to the other. But it kind of the Lorentz group, the SL2C Lorentz group we know, is supposed to sit as kind of a diagonal thing, which is both right, right, and left. But what I'm kind of arguing is that, no, you can actually set things up so that the, the Lawrence group is just one of these two factors. It could have been the right factor, left factor. You have to make your choice of convention. But so it is very much a chiral setup. But you only, the strange thing about this is you only really see this when you complexify. If you just look at Minkowski space time, you know, you don't actually see this, anyway, you don't see this problem or you don't see this ability to make this distinction. It's only when you go to Euclidean space time where the rotation group really does split into two completely distinct right and left things. Or if you go to a complexified space time where you have this two copies of SL2C, it's only in those contexts that you actually see that there is a difference between choosing the diagonal and choosing the right-handed side. So for SL2C, you call that the Lorentz Group. Is that technically the double cover of the Lawrence Group? Yeah, people use both terminology. If you're going to work with spinners, you have to use a double cover. But yes, it's also, yeah, yeah. Sometimes you might want to say that S.O3 is the Lorentz group and this is the double cover. But most of you're working, you're interested in doing working with spinners, and then you have to use the double cover, really. Yes, yes. So is there a reason that triple covers or quadruple covers aren't talked about much? Is it just because of experiment? There's nothing there. Well, it's more than mathematics that they don't. There is, I mean, there is, the rotation groups of any kind, you know, have this, have this twofold nature. There is this spin double cut. There is this, they have these spin double covers. In many cases, you can kind, one way of seeing this is just a basic topology, the topology of rotations has a, you know, has a plus and minus thing in it, which you kind of, and you have to do something about that. So there aren't any kind of known, mathematically interesting, triple covers, etc. Now, in the standard model, the way that it's written in bundle language is that it's a principal bundle, and then the gauge groups are the structure groups. And then for general relativity, you have a tangent bundle. And then some people say that the gauge group of GR is the dipheomorphism group. But is there a way of making that into a bundle, like a principal bundle with the diphomorphism group? How is one supposed to understand that as a bundle construction? Yeah, yeah. Anyway, there's a lot of different ways. There's several different ways of thinking about geometry and about Romanian geometry. And yeah, and this starts to get a complicated subject. But maybe the best way to, well, thinking in terms of different amorphism groups is something you can do. It's actually not my favorite way of doing this kind of geometry. And for the reason is that it, maybe let me just say something about an alternate way of thinking about geometry, which seems to me more powerful. Maybe actually to motivate this a little bit better. If you just think about diffamorphism groups, it's very, very hard to understand what spinners are and where they come from. You really kind of can't see them at all if you're just thinking about the diphthomorph group of a manifold. So the the other formulation of geometry going back to Carton, which makes it much, makes it much easy to see where spinners are going on going and is a lot more powerful in other respects, is to think not about your not about a manifold, but about a bigger space, which is a bundle that for each point in the manifold, you consider all possible bases for the tangent bundle. It's also called frames. And so this is sometimes called the frame bundle. And so it's kind of saying if you want to understand geometry, you should look at the points of space and time. But at the same point, you also got to think about the tangent space and you should think about the possible bases of the tangent space and the so-called frames. So you should always kind of think, instead of writing all your formulas in terms of local coordinates on the manifold, you should think about your problem as being a problem that lives up on the frame bundle and that you always, you're not just, you're not just at a point to space time, but you've also got a frame. And then, but then you have to be careful to kind of work kind of equivariantly that you have, you know, you can change your choice of frame. You can rotate your frames. So you have, you kind of work up in the frame bundle, but equivariantly with respect to rotations or whatever. So that's, that gives a lot more structure to the problem. In particular, it allows you to easily say what spinners are, which you couldn't if you just talked about. So, so anyway, there's a lot more one could say about Diffey Morphor's in groups and that, but just in terms of the relation to the spinner stuff, maybe it's just to forget about it. Just to say it that way. It's not, you have to do something quite different if you're going to talk about spinner. Right. Okay, now the problem you were working on earlier that you said you weren't sure if it would have a solution and you're finding that it does what was it in the early part of the conversation which you were working on your research interests well do you mean right at the beginning where i'm still what i'm still confused about yeah okay but it seemed to me that you were saying you're solving the problem. Oh, this. Yeah. So this was, I mean, this was actually, it goes back to when I was graduate student or postdoc, it was first occurred to me. You know, actually maybe to kind of explain how this all came about. So I was a graduate student in Princeton and I was working on lattice gauge theory. So we're working on this kind of formulation of Yang-Mill's theory on a lattice. And so you could actually do computer calculations of it. And so I was trying to understand, you know, there's a lot of interest in topological effects in Yang-Mills theory. And I was trying to understand how to study those in the kind of numerical calculations on the lattice. And then, so I made some progress on that. But then the next thing that really occurred to me was exactly as spinners came up. It's like, besides having Yang Mills theory on a lattice, we also want to put spinner fields on the lattice. So there's this really beautiful way of putting gauge fields in the lattice, the Yang Mills theory, which kind of respects the geometric nature of the gauge fields very, very nicely. It's kind of the Wilson's lattice gauge theory. But there isn't, if you try and put spinners in the lattice, a lot of very mysterious things happen. And again, in some sense, the problem is that if you're just looking at this lattice that you've written down, it's clear kind of what the discrete analogs of vectors are and of planes and of those things. But it's very, very unclear what, since you don't really have a good way of thinking about spinners in terms of kind of standard geometry of, you know, lines, planes, et cetera, you don't really know how to put the spinners on a lattice in a way that respects their geometry. And if you try to write down the formulas or do anything, you run into a lot of weird problems. There's a lot of, anyway, there's a long story about what happens if you can try with spinners and lattice. Is this related to doubling, like the species doubling? Yeah, so there's one, yeah, so one thing you find is that you really, there's no kind of consistent way to put kind of a single kind of Fermion in the lattice, that if you try and do it, any way you know of doing it kind of produces all these kind of extra versions of the same thing and you have to somehow disentangle those. That's part of the problem. Okay. But that's when I started thinking about the geometry of spinners and some ideas about putting them on the lattice. And then what I was seeing, I started to see that, wait a minute, you know, if you, so this is all happening in Euclidean space where the rotation group is a copy of two SU2 u s u.u2s there's again a left-handed one or a right-handed one if you like and um what i was seeing really was that the some of the choices of it the geometry is trying to use to put these things in the lattice gave me kind of things occurring and kind of multiplets that that look that had the same SU2 structure as what you see in a generation of electro weak particles so in a generation of electro week um like to be particles that you for instance have you have a neutrino left end of neutrinos and you have right-handed left-hand electrons for instance. And those have certain transformation properties under the SU2 and under a U-1. And those were the same ones that I was seeing when I was trying to construct these spinners. So I had the, so it seemed to me, if you can think of part of this rotation group, this SU2, as an internal symmetry, as the symmetry of the weak interactions of the Weinberg's Sala model, then you could actually, anyway, you got all sorts of interesting things to happen. But the thing that this, but making this idea work really required that some explanation of why in Euclidean space, what you thought were spacetime symmetries that really broke up into half space time symmetries and half an internal, internal symmetries, which didn't affect space time. So I never, this is what for many years after looking at this, it was like, well, this just can't work. I mean, you can't, if you just look at the whole formalism for how you've set this up and, you know, both of these SC2s have to be space time temperatures. You can't, they're both going to affect space time. You can't, you can't get away from that. Other people didn't see this as a problem? No, no, I think everybody saw this as a problem. I mean, I think anybody who ever looked at this idea of trying to get, you know, one of the, part of the four-dimensional rotation symmetry to be an internal symmetry has probably backed away, backed away from it for the same reason, saying, well, wait a minute, this can't, you know, I just can't see how that could actually happen, that you have to, you're telling me this should be an internal subject which doesn't affect space time, but it looks to me that you're rotating space time with it, so you can't do that. And so this is what, for many years, kind of kept me from going back to that, from those ideas. And as I learned more about quantum filter, actually, one motivation, as I was teaching this course on quantum filtering, quantum filtering in the back of my mind is, okay, you know, as I go along and teach this course, I may not explain this to the students, but I'm going to very, very carefully look at the formalism and I'm going to understand exactly how this analytic continuation is working of these spinners. And I'm going to, you know, and I'm going to see that you know it looks like this has to work and I'll finally understand why and then I can stop thinking about this but but I kind of as I was teaching this as I was looking at this I kind of never actually saw you know anyway I never actually really saw the argument for why this why this be a space side of symmetry. It looked like it had to, but you couldn't quite pin down why. Anyway, so then when I went back to the twister stuff, I became convinced that if you think about everything in terms of twisters, then the whole twister setup is naturally, chirally, asymmetric. So you kind of, from the twister point of view, this kind of thing looked a lot more plausible, and I got more interested in it again. But it's only very recently, the last few weeks, the last couple months, that I've kind of, I kind of have a very good understanding of exactly why it seemed that, you know, that what I, that why I was right, that this should be impossible. There is a standard assumption that you're making, which makes what I wanted to do impossible. But it's also possible to not make that assumption and do something else. And that assumption is? It's the symmetry between right and left. It's kind of when you go between Minkowski and Euclidean spinners, you know, the setup that you use to analytically continue, do you do that in a setup which is right-left symmetric? And if you want the setup to be holomorphic then you have to use the right left symmetric one but what it's so simultaneously i realize yes you can yeah yes i mean this in the standards there was a very very good reason that i and everyone is skeptical that this can make sense but there there actually is a way around it. You can just decide, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to just use right-handed spinners, and I'm going to, and you can get a theory that makes sense. I don't know if I'm jumping ahead, but I recall in one of the lectures that I saw online of you, and you were giving the lecture, I believe Cole Fury was in the audience, you were saying that what we have to use are hyper functions. Yeah. Am I jumping ahead because you're saying, no, no, it's not going to be holomorphic? No, but actually hyperfunctions are really part of the holomorphic story. They're, yeah, they're not, they're, I mean, hyper functions are really just saying, so so what I was saying when I was trying to explain this business about you know why about WIC rotation and that and that things were that if you write down the standard formulas you end up with something in a Kasek space on which is ill-defined okay and then you have to use it via Rick Rotation or analytic continuation. There's just another way of saying that more, putting in a more interesting mathematical context, is to say that the things that you're looking at in Kowski-space time are not actually normal functions. They really are what am I? They are best thought of as hyper functions. In this case, they're hyper functions, which are just, um, analytic, which are just kind of bound, boundary values of analytic things as you, uh, approach, uh, approach the real line. But, um, yes, so the hyper function story is just kind of part of the standard. It's really part of the weird rotation story. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But what I'm, I mean, this latest thing I'm trying to do actually gets away from analytic continuation. You're not, you really, I'm really, I'm still kind of, you know, trying to wrap my head around exactly what the implications of this are. But you are, you're not doing the standard sort of analytical continuation anymore. The standard sort of way of analytically continuing, which uses all four space time dimensions, that you're not, you're not doing that. You're doing something, something different and it's unclear. Anyway, I mean, if you start writing out formulas, you'll still get the same story with hyper functions. What prompted you to then go look at twisters? And by the way, is it called a twister formalism or twister formulation? I don't know. Either one is... I don't know if those are used interchangeably. Because I hear, for instance, that there's different quantum formalisms like Vigners or interaction or path or categorical. But then sometimes I hear, yeah, the categorical formulation of quantum mechanics. I'm like, okay, you get the idea. Well, they're not, I mean, the thing about Twisters is they're not actually, I mean, maybe a good thing to say about Twisters is, we don't actually know exactly what their relevance is to the real world. So you might, if you had a, if you have a well-developed idea using Twisters for describing the real world and you wanted to contrast it to other similar descriptions, you might want to say, oh, this is the Twister formalism or maybe Twister formulation. I don't know. But it's a little bit, but either one is a little bit premature in terms of physics, that we don't actually know exactly how the twisters are related to the real world. So it's not like you can translate a real world problem to twister formalism and then back? Well, you can, so twisters, maybe... So twisters are a bit like spinners, but the, um, so they have some of the mathematical properties of spinners, but, but they do something more interesting. They're kind of a higher dimensional thing. Maybe one of the best things to say about them is that they're, um, they're very useful. If you want, if you, so if you want to understand Minkowski space time, you know, you, this is what Einstein figured out. You can, you can use Minkowski's geometry, Minkowski metric, if you want to talk about just vectors and metrics and tensors, or if you talk about Mokowski space type spinners, if you want, and that's what I've been most interested in. But the other interesting thing about our theory is when we write them down in Mikowski space time. Theories of mass of massless fields and things like Yang Mill's theory, they have this bigger invariance group than just under rotations and translations. They're conformally invariant. So the geometry of chrysters really comes into its own, if you're trying to describe to understand the properties of space time under conformal transformations. And anyway, so that's kind of a motivation. So if you don't care about conformal transformations, you may not be very interested in spinners, but if you really want to understand, you know, what is, how do I write down my theories and how do I have a version of you of Metcowski space time that, where the conformal group acts in a nice linear fashion and where everything works out. And the spinner, now you can call it a formalism or formulation, but it's a way of doing conformal geometry. It really comes into its own. So that's, so spinners, you know, go, I mean, twisters go way, way back. And, you know, this really was mainly Roger Penrose is doing in the 60s. And, you know, and he was very interested in using them to understand, you know, things happening in Minkowski space time and especially the conformal invariance of these things. And so there's a huge amount of effort and a lot of beautiful things discovered during the 70s, especially by him and his collaborators in Kowski space time. And then Atiyah realized that you could take this over and do some very, very interesting things in Ramanian geometry and Euclidean space time. Yeah. So, I mean, I was, you know, I kind of learned about this geometry at raise points. That sentence could be said about Atea in the most general form. And then Atia realized you could use this for underscore with geometry. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So anyway, so I've been kind of aware about Twisters for a long time, but I, you know, I didn't see. Anyway, I actually wrote a very speculative paper long, long ago about this. And it mentioned the connection to twisters, but there's just a lot about them that, you know, I didn't understand back then. It took me many years to understand. And especially the relationship between is Euclidean signature and Minkasee signature spinners, how they're related is. That's quite a tricky story, which takes me a long time and understand. So you have the splinter in your thumb for decades about the spacetime symmetries and them acting not just on spacetime. What happened in 2020 and 2021? I'm trying to think. Now, I'm trying to think what specific one thing had happened in 2020 was COVID so right in your mind what happened so 2019 then no no no but this is actually relevant because actually in 2020 I was much more and I was thinking of this stuff but yeah but yeah but in 2020 all of a sudden you're kind of you know you're at home you're at home that you're just sitting there and uh i all the opposite home and i don't have a lot of all the usual distractions or whatever and so and so that actually um i actually gave me some of the more time to kind of think peacefully about uh about some of this stuff and make some progress yeah so i'd have i'd have to i mean i kind remember now that, you know, exactly which things became clear at which times. But it's been a slow, it was a slow process of various things clarifying. But I think maybe that was one of the main things, is to finally get a picture in mind of how Euclidean and Minkowski twist your theory all fit together. Awesome. How does it fit? Is there a way of explaining it? Well, I mean, maybe the best thing to say about twister theory is that it really kind of naturally wants to be a theory of complex space time. And this is the thing. If you write, if you say, I'm going to study four-dimensional complex space time and I'm interested in its conformal group and things like that, then the Twister story is actually very, very simple. It's very, I mean, you're basically just saying that there's a four-complexed dimensional space and a point in space time is a complex two plane in that four-dimensional space. So points, anyway, yeah, so instead of thinking of the way of normal thinking of some space with these points, well, you've got to think about, just think about the complex two planes and complex four-dimensional space, and, you know, everything just kind of drops out of that. And there is one, there's a beautiful relation of that story to the theory of spinners, is that, and this is kind of the relationship between the theory of twister and theory of spinners. In twister theory, a point in four-dimensional space-time is a complex two plane. That by definition of what a point is. And now that, but that complex two plane. That's the definition of what a point is. But that complex two plane, that kind of tautologically answers the question of where do these spinners come from? Because the space of spinners is a complex two plane. Well, you know, so from the standard point of view, it's like, you know, as I was saying, if you just think about the diphthomorphism, it's very, very hard to even say what a spinner is. So where are these weird complex two planes coming from? Well, from the point of view of twister theory, it's purely tautological. It's just, you know, the two plane is a point. So the spinner, the spin one-half two-plane, complex two-plane is describing the spin of a of an electron is exactly a point anyway that that's exactly what what the definition of a point is so you can't a point in twister space or a point in space time spilling in space time yeah so as twister space is a four thing. And but the points in it, and so the points in it correspond to various structures in space-time, but the complex two planes in it correspond to the points in space-time. Anyway, that's one of the basic. Yeah. So then is the statement that the points in spacetime are the same as spinners or the points in space- or the structure of space time gives rise to the structure of spinners and vice versa or are none of those statements correct? I think, yeah, I know, I think both of them. I mean, it really is telling you, Twister theory is really telling you that it's a way of thinking about space time in which... And sorry, this is four dimensional space time. Four dimensional space time, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a way of thinking about, yeah. So, Twister theory is very, very special to four-dimensions. It doesn't really is, it's a way of thinking about space-time in which, you know, the occurrence of spinners and their properties are just completely tautological. They're just built into the very definitions. Sociologically, why do you think it is that Penrose's Twister program, firstly, has been allowed to continue because many other programs just die out if you're not loop or string or causal or asymptotic. Like there's just four as far as I can tell. Five with Penrose. So why is it alive, and then why hasn't it caught on? Well, for, I mean... Or maybe you disagree. It's not alive. No, no, no. It's very much alive. It's very much alive. And still... And so there's an interesting kind of history. But a lot of it was really... So he had this idea, and he's raised places as explaining how he came up with it. And he was very, very struck by this. And, you know, so he quite successfully at Oxford built up a group of people working on this. And so, you know, it was a good example of kind of how normal science kind of works sociologically. You know, somebody comes up with a good idea and they actually build a group of people around them and people do, as people do more work, they learn more interesting things about this more people get interested so you know he always you know throughout the 70s I would say into the 80s there always was a quite healthy group of people you know working on pedros or people somehow having some relation to penrose collaborators were working on this so it was um anyways but perfectly but perfectly normal science. It wasn't so clear, though, how to get, it was clear, some things were very clear, some things were clear that this was really a beautiful way of writing down conformally invariant way of equations and studying their properties. So there were, there was, the beauty of the idea and the power to do certain things was known. But it didn't seem to be necessary or have any particular connection to specific problems in particle physics. So particle physicists would look at this and say, well, that's nice, but, you know, I don't, that doesn't actually tell me anything. You know, if I needed to do some conformally invariant calculations, I might be able to use that, but it's not actually telling me something really that, you know, really knew I can't get elsewhere. And then, you know, and then in the 80s, you also had, you know, Atea got into the game, and there's a lot of mathematicians got into it through the, the relations to the, on the Euclidean side. So, you know, it was, you know, especially among mathematicians, mathematical physicists, it was a fairly, it remained a very active area, and it still is to this day, you know. A lot of it was based in Oxford, but also a lot of other places. But yeah, I think the, but in terms of its implications for physics, you know, I would say the thing that to me is, I think Penrose and his people trying to connect this to physics in an interesting way, they kind of ran into, anyway, they kind of ran out of new ideas. There are some things that they could do, but they couldn't actually get any kind of a really killer app, if you like. And the big, and from my point of view, I mean, I don't know if I can, I think, anyway, I don't know if I'll ever be able to convince them or what they think of it these days. But the problem was that they were thinking of connecting this to physics purely from the Minkowski space-time side. So they're looking at Minkowski space-time twisters, Minkowski-space-time spinners. And those, the twister theory just didn't, if you just look at Minkowski-Space time, you don't see the sort of new things, which I'm finding interesting, which I think tell you something new about particle physics. You don't see this kind of internal, the fact that one of these factors can be an internal symmetry. You just can't see that in Rikowsky space time. And then so, and then there's some other more technical things about, I better not get into that. But the, there's kind of, well. It's okay. The audience is generally extremely educated in physics and math. Yeah, I would actually, well, maybe to connect this to what I'm saying, right, is I think, you know, also the way people think about general relativity in, you know, in Cassidy's signature, general relativity is not a chiral theory. It's supposed to be right invariant, parity symmetric theory. So the problem with thinking about general relativity in terms of twisters is that your setup is completely a chiral. So you can, you naturally end up with, if you try and do gravity with it, you end up with kind of something that's not quite the right theory of gravity. It's kind of a chiral version of gravity. Anyway, this is a very interesting story, but I think Penrose always referred to this as the Googly problem. Right, right. Something about cricket. Yeah, and cricket, there's something about how the balls. We're North American, so yeah. Yeah, so anyway, but so if you know about cricket, you can definitely, maybe this makes more sense to you, but he always referred to this as a Googly problem that he was kind of, in the twister theory, he's only getting one, he's only getting things spinning one way. And, but anyways, but you can see from my point of view, that's evident that was always, that's evidence of exactly what I'm trying to say now that, well, space time is right-handed. Yes. Yeah. So it's a related problem. But that was always kind of a, so Penrose and the people around them, I think, put a lot of effort into trying to revamp twister theory into something chirally symmetric. Now, why would they want to do that if the standard model isn't? Well, they weren't really trying to describe the standard model. They never really have to do. They thought Twisters were way of thinking about space time, so they wanted to do general relativity. And general relativity is not a chiral theory. So they were trying trying to find kind of a how do we get rid of all this chirality and uh and they never really successful at that so you're saying it's a pro not a con yeah yeah exactly it's a feature not a bug yeah right right but in terms one interesting fun thing that the sociology though is that what um know, so the idea that you could get, use twisters to quantify, to do general relativity and perhaps quantize it, that was always something which, you know, Penrose and his people were working on, but, you know, most physicists, I think, felt that wasn't really going anywhere. This wasn't going to work. And maybe Witten was probably one, was an example of somebody I think who really could see the mathematical power of these ideas and how important they were as new ideas about geometry. Again, that's a general statement that can be said. And then Ed Witten saw the power of this mathematics. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so he, I think even going back to a postdoc, he learned about Twisters, he was trying to do some things with it. But he never kind of, but he then actually finally found something. And this was about 20 years ago. And what became known as the Twister string. So he actually became, he found a way of kind of writing, you know, a different way of writing down the, um, perturative calculations in Yang Mills in terms of, um, of a sort of string theory, except it's a very different kind of string theory than the one that, the one that's supposed to be the theory of everything. And, and it's a theory where the string lives in twister space. So, Written wrote this really kind of beautiful, very, very beautiful paper about twister string theory. And so, and so since Witten is talking about twisters, of course, all of a sudden there's a lot of physicists who were never had, I think, good to say about twisters, or all of a sudden are rushing out to learn about twisters. So that, and there's, but there's been an ongoing story of, um, of this twister string story, which is a lot of people have done a lot of things. But again, a lot of it hasn't really worked out the way people like, and for the same reason as Penner, that Penner's always had, that the people are trying to quantify is a chirally version, a chirally symmetric version of general relativity using this thing. And that's not what it really wants to do. So anyway, but that's sociologically very important about why most high-energy physicists have more, have heard about twisters and don't, and often have nice things to say about them is because of the twister string. Okay, there are quite a few questions that I have. Okay, one is the particle physicists' repudiation of twister theory or just distancing from it because it's not useful to them. Is that something that they also slung at string theory or were they more embracing of it? Wait, so, I'm not quite sure. Who do you kind of mean? Who do we, are we talking about you? I'm not sure. Earlier, you said that the particle physicists weren't initially adopting string theory, sorry, twister theory because it didn't provide them with anything that's new. You said, well, okay, if we need to do some conformally invariant calculation, we'll use twister theory. Yeah. But at the same time, string theory is known, or at least colloquially known for not producing what's useful to high energy physicists, but useful outside of high energy like to mathematics or maybe condensed matter physics but what I'm asking is around the same time when they were distancing themselves from Twister theory or not using it were they then embracing of string theory or they gave the same critique well okay so we have to you should start if we're talking about string theory yeah that's a kind of complex, this is kind of a complex story. And it has the whole story of particle physics and string theory, that's pretty much completely disconnected from twisters because, I mean, the issues that, that, that, you know, people, about why people were doing string theory or why they might mind or might, I want to do string theory it really had nothing to do with twisters the twisters is kind of a yeah anyway especially a geometric framework and then you know and then twisters kind of make a small kind of appearance due to witten at one point 20 years ago but that's kind of about it um yeah so i mean i i i can maybe we we can start talking this about the whole string theory and particle physics business, but I'm not twister. Anyway, just twisters, it seems like a bad place to start. I'm not trying to mix up twisters with it. What I just meant to say was it's interesting what gets accepted and what doesn't. Yeah. And so why was string theory accepted? Take us through the history of that. And also you could tell people who may have just heard the name, sorry, Ed Witten. But all they know about him is that he's a genius. But they don't realize that influence that he has. Yeah, okay, so this is a good place to start. Yeah. And, you know, Witten is really kind of central to this story. And so, you know, I think the short summary of the history of this subject of particle physics was that, you know, by 1973, you had this thing called the standard model, which was this, you know, incredibly successful way of talking about particle physics and capturing everything that you see when you, you know, in these, when you do energy physics experiments. And the story And the story, when I kind of came in, it feels, I went to start learning about, probably started reading books and things about what's happening and particle physics probably right around the mid-70s. I went to college in 75, and I spent most of my college career, a lot of it learning about the standard model and this stuff and then and um so by but but by the time I left grad grad school set I mean by time I left college in 1979 and I went to graduate school at Princeton people were starting to get yeah people had had spent had now spent you know sit let's just six years let's say trying to figure out how to do better than the standard model and one one thing is how to do find some kind of new anyway how to do better the standard model as a theory of particle physics but also but one thing is the standard model doesn't give you a quantum theory of gravity so the other thing thing was, how do we get a quantum theory of gravity? So these were kind of the big problems that are already in the air. And Witten, you know, so Witten is a genius. And he had been a grad student in Princeton. He actually came to Harvard as a postdoc, I think, in 77, 78. And I met him when he was actually was a postdoc. And he quickly started doing some really amazing things. I went to Princeton 79. A year or two later, he actually, you know, he went directly from a postdoc at Harvard to becoming a full professor at Princeton, becoming a professor of Princeton very quickly. And so the years I was in Princeton as a graduate student were from 79 to 84, and those were years, you know, people I think were getting more and more frustrated. There are lots of ideas coming up, but every idea that people kind of tried to do better than the standard model, or maybe to quantize gravity, really didn't, you know, didn't quite work. I think there's a lot of, and people were kind of cycling every six months through. There's some new idea you'd work on it for six months or a year, and people start to realize, well, this doesn't really do what we want to do. Let's find something else. So there were a lot of new ideas, but nothing really working out. But Witten then, you know, he had been interested. There was this idea that was very unpopular. There were very few people were working on to try to quantize gravity and unify it with the particle physics through string theory. And so it was, you know, people like John Schwartz and Michael Green were working on this, but it was a very small group of people, and there wasn't much attention being paid to that. But, you know, Witten was paying attention to. I think one thing to say about him is that besides being very, very smart, he's also somebody who can, you know, read people's ideas or talk to them and absorb new ideas very, very quickly. So, you know, he was kind of also spending a lot of time looking around, trying to see, you know, what other ideas are either out there. And this was one that he got interested in. But for various reasons, technical reasons, he thought, you know, this, there's a technical reason, so-called anomaly calculations about why this is not going to work out. And what happened right in the fall of 84, I actually went as a postdoc to Stony Brook. And the right around that time, Green and Schwartz had done this calculation that showed that these anomalies canceled, except there's some specific case where these anomalies canceled. And so Witten then became very excited about the idea that, you know, you could use in that specific case of this so-called super string theory to, yeah. so so so so so so witten heard about this and he said it said okay you know the thing that had in my mind why super string theory couldn't work as a unified theory and now it looks maybe like maybe you can get around that so he kind of then started working full full time on trying to you know come up with models or understand super string models that you could use the de unification. And so throughout kind of, I was now at Stony Brook, but I was kind of hearing reports of what's going out at Princeton. And throughout late 84, 85, 86, this was, you know, Witten and the people around him, this is what they were working on, Bobora. And they were, you know, they had a very specific picture in mind. It was that, you know, the super string only is consistent in 10 dimensions. You, so you can get rid of four of them by the so-called Calabial compactification. And hopefully there's only a few of these collabiaws. And one of those is going to describe the real world and you know we're all going to have this wonderful beautiful unified theory using this kind of six-dimensional geometry of claudeaos and we're going to have it within the next year or two and that was the way they were thinking and you know a lot of the people you know friends and colleagues of mine who you know we're doing kind of the thing that you would often do is go down and go you know when you're in princeton go talk to witten and say here's here's what i'm working on you know can you what do you think about this and i got several of them reported back to me yeah you know i went down to prince i talked to whitton and he said well you know what you're working on that's all right i said well it's good but know, you really should be working on string theory because that's actually, you know, we're all the actions and that's really, and you know, we're almost going to have the theory of everything there and you kind of work on string theory. So, you know, this just had a huge effect. So, and this was called the so-called first super string revolution. And, you know, there's a story over the next five or ten years of how, you know, people were brought into this field and people, some people are always skeptical. But, you know, it kind of gained more and more influence and became institutionalized during kind of the decade after that. And in some sense, the weird thing, the weird thing, the weird thing that's hard to understand string theory is why, you know, once it became clear, these ideas really weren't working out, why didn't, you know, this just fall by the wayside and people go and do something else? But 40 years later, we're still, it's still here. And so it's a very strange story. So what do you see as the main physics, physical problem or even mathematical problem of string theory? Do you see it as, well, how do we search this landscape or how do we find the right manifold, the six-dimensional caler manifold? Yeah, I think that was always the thing that bothered me about it from the beginning, which I think is the fundamental problem. It's, and it's a fundamental problem whenever you decide to do to use higher dimensional Romanian geometry, if you, I mean, this actually goes back to Einstein, Einstein and these Kluza Klein models. You know, people have often said, okay, well, you know, we had this beautiful theory of fourdimensional geometry in Einstein general relativity, and we have this particle physics stuff going on, which seems to have some interesting geometry to it. So let's just, let's just add some dimensions and write down a theory in five or seven or ten or whatever dimensions, and then do geometry there, and that's going to solve, and that's going to be the unified theory. So I mean, this is sort of thing Einstein was thinking about. But if you start thinking about this, the problem is you realize that these kind of internal dimensions that the geometry of particle physics and the geometry of special relativity are quite different. They're not, you know, they're these metric degrees of freedom in four dimensions. And if you try and you don't really have those in, in like in the standard model, you just doesn't have things like that. So if you put those sort of dynamical variables into there, the ability for these for these other dimensions by the four one to two, you you have a vast you you hugely increase the number of degrees of freedom and you have a theory with where you have to now explain why all this extra geometry which you've put in there and and which you're only trying to get a kind of small kind of very rigid kind of couple pieces of information out why is are all these infinite number of degrees of freedom why how can you just ignore them how can you you have to find a dynamics consistent dynamics for them and then you and that consistent dynamics has to explain why you don't see them yeah and so that's always been the problem with like Kaluza Klein models and with any kind of extra dimensional models. And string theory just kind of has this problem in spades. You know, you're instead of feel, instead of point particles, you have strings. They have a huge number of new degrees of freedom. You have to say that, well, the string vibrations are all happening at such high energies we can't see them. And then the extra 60, then they're trying to use the fact that super strings have very special properties in 10 dimensions. And they're trying to use that to argue that our strings are moving in 10 dimensions and that four are the ones we see and six are going to be described particle physics and so anyways it becomes a very complicated theory you have to write down in order to kind of make any of this work and make any of this look like physics and the from the beginning there was kind of no story about why is anything that looks like the real world going to drop out of this, you know, and why that? And that's still the case 40 years later. And the whole thing just suffers from this problem that you don't, you don't actually have't actually have the theory there's kind of a when you say that you have a string theory and people say oh we have this mathematically elegant well-defined unique theory they're talking about that's not a full theory that that's that's a perturbative limit of a theory and so what they really need in order to answer the questions they want to answer is they need something more general, a so-called non-perturbitive kind of general version of string theory. And sometimes people call it M theory. So if you want, we can call it M theory. And they need an M-theory. And nobody knows what M-theory is. No one has come up. You can write down a list of properties that, you know, M, M theory is supposed to be some theory with this list of properties, but you can't actually write down a theory. And so on the one hand, you don't actually have a real theory that you can nail down and say, this is a theory, we're going to solve it and look at the solutions and see if they look like the real world. So what you, what people end up doing is saying, well, we don't really know what the theory is. Let's assume that, but it seems that maybe there's one that has some properties that look like the real world. So let's work with that. And then try to constrain, see what constraints we can get out of it will tell us, you know, are we seeing something like the real world? And then they just end up finding that, no, there aren't really useful constraints that you can get almost anything out of it. So you get this landscape of all possibilities. Yes. And then, you know, 20 years ago, things got very weird when people just started to say, well, you know, instead of saying that normally if you have a theory, it can't predict anything because, you know, almost everything is a solution to it. You say, okay, well, that was a bad idea and you move on. Instead, you saw people saying, oh, well, it just means the real world is, you know, almost everything is a solution to it. You say, okay, well, that was a bad idea and you move on. Instead, you saw people saying, oh, well, that's, it just means the real world is, you know, all of these possible things exist in the real world and the multiverse and, yeah, and just for, you know, for anthropic reasons, we happen to live in this random one. And, you know, I mean, anyway, it's, the fact that anyone ever took any of that seriously is just still kind of, I don't have any explanation for it. It's just far. Yeah. Okay, so to summarize, somewhere around, this is not a part of the story that was said, but somewhere around the 1960s, some amplitude called the Veneziano, I think, Veneziano. I don't know how to pronounce it. Yeah, the name. Venetia. That was the first inklings of string theory and it had to do, was come up with because of the strong force. They were trying to solve something. Then it was forgotten about. And then around the 1980s, there were some other problems with string theory that were solved. And so this is the Green Schwartz anomaly cancellation. Yeah. And then some people say that that was the first revolution. But it's also more accurate to say that that precipitated Ed Witten to take it seriously. And then that's what precipitated the first string revolution. Okay, then from there, then you realize that there are different ways, something like 5 to the 100 or 10 to the 500 or some extreme amount that if you were to do some naping calculation, all those books behind you, the amount of words ever written, not just books ever published, words ever written, I think easily letters ever written, like single letters, it would be like saying, find this one letter in every single book that's ever been written, including all the ones that have been on fire and underwater and so on. Okay, that's not such a problem if you can figure out how to reduce the search space. But if you can't, then it turns out the problem is NP-complete, which means you just have to brute force. Is that a correct summary? Well, actually, maybe you go back to one thing and say, yeah, so this is one part of the story I didn't say, is that string theory had originally come out as a potential theory of the strong interactions. And that actually was one reason Witten, I think, was looking at it, is that so one of the open problems that the standard model left open was how do you solve the strong we have this strong interaction theory but how do you solve it and it looked like maybe you could you could use the old ideas about strings to solve it and I actually spent a lot of time learning about strings as a graduate student because of that and I was really to Witten but but the with um this kind of multiplicity of solutions of string theory of is that it's not just that there are too many of them it's just that you don't actually have a definition of the problem you know so so people this kind of drives me crazy people often talk about well the problem is that we don't know how to put a measure on the space of solutions of string theory. And if we could put a measure, then we can figure out, you know, maybe it's concentrated someplace. Right. And that would be great. But I keep pointing out that the problem is not that you don't have a measure of the space. The problem is that you have no idea what the space is. As I was saying, you know, to even define what a string theory solution is requires knowing precisely what M theory is. You don't know it. There are no equations anyone can write down which you say, you know, if we were smart enough and we look and could find all the solutions to this, this would, you know, these are all the solutions of string theory. You just don't have that. So all of the things that you do have, like you can go out and say, well, well, maybe it's these gadgets and you have 10 and the 500 of them or whatever. Those are all just kind of cooked together possible approximations to what you think might be a string theory solution. Those are not, there are solutions to some equations you've written down, which are not, they are not the equations of string theory. There's something you wrote down and think maybe these things have something to do with string theory. So the problem is much worse than any of these practical problems of there's too many of these things. And this whole business, and now it's become kind of an industry that, well, let's apply machine learning techniques to this. And it's just, I mean, you're just applying. Anyway, you're just. Does this frustrate you? Yes. I mean, this data is garbage. You know, so you basically are throwing, you basically do not actually know what your problem is. So you're cooking up something which you can feed to a computer, but it actually is kind of known to be garbage. And you're doing processing on this and producing more garbage and, you know, getting grants to do this and going around telling people that you're looking for the universe the universe I mean it's real that's just utter nonsense I'm sorry many people don't know because they don't know the history but since 2010s it's become somewhat cool to dunk on string theory at least in the popular press okay maybe not inside academia but you were alone you and Lee Smollin were lone wolves. Early lone wolves. Can you talk about that and talk about some of the flak you took, maybe still take? Yeah. Anyway, it was certainly a very strange experience, a very strange time. But, you know, I think the thing to say is that throughout, you know, I was never, I was always fairly skeptical about string theory, but, you know, initially for many years my attitude was, well, you know, throughout, you know, I was never, I was always fairly skeptical about string theory, but, you know, initially for many years, my attitude was, well, you know, who knows, you know, is certainly very smart. These people are, you know, they're going to, sooner or they'll figure out for them, either they'll figure out this works or they'll, or they'll do something else. But then, you know, just as time went by, years went by and that this was just not happening. And you had more and more and more kind of popular books you know i have to confess maybe in some sense it's somewhat of a reaction to uh to brian green who is a my friend and colleague here in at columbia but uh you know so he did a very very good job of with pbs specials convincing the world that you know this this was a successful this was an idea on the way to success when it really wasn't. So I thought, okay, well, somebody should, you know, sit down and write a book about, you know, what the real situation here is. And, you know, it's not like when I talk to people privately about this, you know, I would say that people who are not string theorists mostly would would say, yeah, you know, yeah, you're probably right. This is not, this doesn't seem to be going anywhere, but you know, whatever. And then the, and people, and when I talk to string theorists, I have plenty of strength theorists, they would often say, yeah, you know, yeah, there are a lot of huge problems and we just, we don't really know anything better to do right now is where we're going to keep doing this. But yeah, yeah, all these problems you're pointing out are really, yeah, they're real. And, um, so what's wrong with that? Well, it was, the weird thing was, I think was this disjunction, this disjunction between the private opinions of people, what people were saying to each other privately, what you, private had said, and what you were seeing in, in the popular press. And, you know, you've, so, and there was, you know, and one aspect of this was people not wanting to kind of publicly criticize something. And partly, and I think the subject became more and more kind of ideological. And the string theorists kind of started to feel kind of in battle. They were very well aware that a lot of their colleagues thought what they were doing was not working. On the other hand, you know, so they became more defensive. And there was a lot more it became. And a lot of people, I think, would tell me, yeah, you know, I agree with a lot of you're saying, but yeah, but don't quote me on this publicly. I don't want to get involved in, you know, in that mess and alienating a lot of my colleagues and who are, anyway, so, but I have this weird status that I'm actually in a math department, not a physics department, and, you know, I don't have a lot of the same reasons that you don't want to annoy some powerful people in physics, like, you know, trying to get grants, get your students jobs, et cetera, et cetera. It didn't really apply to me. So I thought, well, you know, if somebody is going to kind of start a lot of time thinking about this stuff. And I, you know, I spent a lot of time thinking about this stuff. And I started writing this in around 2002, 2003. And the book was finally published. It was a long story about getting it published, but it finally got published in 2006. And in the meantime, Lee Smolin had been writing a book. He was coming from a different direction. Trouble with physics? Yeah, the trouble with physics. And he had his own motivation, so it was trying to write something, I think, more general and sociological, but with this as an example, and I think the way he describes that the example kind of took over the general theory. And so he ended up also writing a book about string theory. And the books ended up coming out at the same time, which I think, you know, it was kind of a force multiplier there that, you know, people, if one person is writing a book which says, well, you know, a lot of the things you're hearing, you're hearing are not right. Or people say, well, that's just one person's opinion. But if two people are doing our same thing, everybody's like, oh, you know, there must be something to this. And so I think the combination of the two books, I think it did have a lot of effect on, it did make a lot of people realize there was a problem here. It made a lot of the strength theories, you know, much more defensive. I mean, it also caused, I think, a lot of people, young people thinking of doing string theory or people doing string theory to decide to move on to something else. But so people very often tell me that, you know, about effects this book had on them or other people they knew in terms of their decisions about what to do with their research or their career. The book is called Not Even Wrong. The links to all resources mentioned will be in the description, including this book. So you mentioned that your colleagues would talk to you privately, and then they would say something else to the popular press. Now, when you say popular press, are you also including grant agencies with that, like just the public in general? Because it's not just a popular science issue, it's also a grant issue where the money goes. Yeah, so it's not just the popular press. And to be clear, I should say, it's not that they would say one thing, one place, it's just, they would carefully just not say, you know, that there were things that they would say in conversation with me or I think in conversations with other people, not just me, that they would just say, okay, this is not something that. Okay, sin of commission versus omission. Yeah, it's not like they were going out and saying, oh, the strength theory is going great. It's just that, you know, anyway, they were, they were not kind of, they were not saying this is really appears to be a failure. But yeah, but you're right. This issue kind of occurs at all levels from, you know, the very, very popular press, from kind of television specials um to you know more more serious popular press or what what gets into scientific american you know what what gets into uh now we have quantum magazine you know which are more more serious uh parts of the parts of the press aimed at the more at the public to um you know all the way down to it yet to exactly um yeah like in grand proposal you know what what do you write in in grant proposals whatever or if you um if you're anyway you're trying to explain to some some kind of funding person or something about what you know what's what's going on in your subject do you um yeah and you know what do you say about string theory and so the you know the string theories i think have often you know that they've i think everybody whatever you're working on you're often forced by this business of getting your students a job or getting a grant to be you know know, to say, to go right up to the boundary of what's defensible and being optimistic about what you're doing. But, and there, you know, so that's what string theorists have certainly always been doing. You could argue, you know, in many cases, it's not different than what other scientists do. But it's, I think the thing which i i have to say i have found more and more disturbing the reaction of and this started when my book came out and i think lees small had a similar reaction the um i think both of us were expecting a much more serious intellectual response to the issues we were raising. We were raising serious, serious technical questions, and we were getting kind of back, you know, kind of, you know, personal attacks. From people in the community or from the public? From people in the community. I mean, I think, you know, what you're getting from people people who don't in the public don't know much about this you're you're getting some completely random combination of people who are annoyed because you're saying something different than what they heard and other people who become your fan because you're saying something different and so you end up sure sure you end up with a huge number of fans who you don't necessarily want as your fans. But anyway, yeah, so both of us were expecting, you know, that, you know, we put a lot of effort into making a, you know, a serious intellectual case about what these problems were. And instead of getting a serious response, we were getting, you know, these kind of personal attacks of how dare you say this. And so, for instance, there's one prominent blogger who decides who would write these endless blog entries about what's wrong with Peter White and what he's doing. And at some point, I was trying to respond to these. And at some point, I realized, you know, what this guy's talking about is nothing to do with what I actually wrote in my book. And then he actually kind of publicly admitted that he was refusing to, he refuses to read the book. So this is a, anyway, this kind of blew my mind. How can you be an academic and engaged in, you know, academic discussion, intellectual issues? And you're spending all this time arguing about a book and you're refusing to read it. mean how it's just really crazy and that was a string theorist yeah or just a colleague yeah okay string theorist yeah speaking of brian green oh sorry continue yeah yeah no yeah no yeah i didn't mean to suggest that no no no but but anyway that's just one example so and i and i think, you know, this is an ongoing, I think, disturbing situation that people are just not, people are kind of defending that field and continued and research there with just kind of refusing to acknowledge the problems or to have kind of serious discussions of it. I think, you know, on your last year, your last thing with Edward Frankel, I think, it's kind of funny because he, you know, I know him and I actually was out visiting him in Berkeley in June or something and were talking about things. And he told me, oh, Peter, I'm, you know, I'm going to go to the strings conference. And it's the first time I've been to a strings conference and now. And, you know, he's heard me go on about this for, and he's kind of nodded his head politely. And, you know, he's saying, well, I'm a mathematician. I'd rather than not, you know, but this sounds a little bit of it. Maybe he's published with Witten. Yeah. And then, you know, so he, and he knows all these people. And he knows a lot about the story, but he, and I think, you know, he knows me well know enough that I'm, you know, I have a somewhat, I'm not a complete fool and I have a somewhat serious point of view, but, you know, maybe I'm really a bit too extreme about this. But then he went to the, this conference. Then when it comes back, he gives me a call, it says, basically, you know, Peter, I didn't realize how bad it really was. You're right. This really is as bad as you've been saying. So it was, anyway. What was bad? The exuberance of the young people or the old people telling, misleading the younger people into a useless pit? Or like, what was, what was bad? Yes, it is as bad as you say. Well, I think what's bad is really just this kind of, this kind of refusal to admit, I mean, this is a field which inflexia has serious problems. Things have not worked out. These ideas really have failed to work. And instead of admitting that, ideas have failed and moving on, people will just kind of keep acting as if that's not true. And so the, you know, I think... Sorry to interrupt. I'm so sorry so why would edward expect an admittance of the failure of string theory at a strings conference i think one thing to say you know i mean part of the story about him is you know he's a mathematician and and you know so mathematicians if you do mathematics the one thing you have to be completely clear about is you know what you understand and what you don't understand and what is a wrong idea and what is a right idea. You know, and if something doesn't work and is wrong, you have to, you can't play a game. You cannot play any games about this. This is, you know, you have to admit that this is wrong. And so I think especially for mathematicians to come in and see an environment where there's You know the kind of guiding ideas that people haven't really haven't really worked out and a lot of things you know are known do not work for known reasons but people are still kind of acting as if this is not true and trying to figure out how to kind of do something and make career for themselves in this environment it's a very no i think he he he recognize that but it is part of it is the um i mean mathematics is a very unusual subject that people things things really are wrong or right and you and you're you know it's you absolutely absolutely cannot seriously make progress in the subject unless you recognize that and uh and mathematicians are also much more used to um they're much more used to being wrong i think one of my colleagues john morgan likes to say that uh you know mathematics is the is the only subject he knows of where you know if two people disagree about something and they each think the other is wrong, they'll go into a room and sit down and talk about it, and then they'll emerge from the room with one of them having admitted he was wrong, the other one was right, and that this is just not, it's not a normal human behavior, but it's something that is part of the mathematical culture. Earlier I said, speaking of Brian Green, and what I meant was I had a conversation with Brian Green about almost a year ago now, and I mentioned, yeah, so Peter White has a potential toe, Euclidean Twister unification, and then he said, oh, does he? Oh, I didn't know. He is in your university, not to put you on the spot, but why is that? Well, it said aloud, I don't think it's true by the professor of physics, mainly who studies string theory. Well, there are so many proposals for toes. Yeah, there are proposals in your inbox, but there aren't serious proposals by other professors. There aren't that many serious proposals of theories of everything, at least not on a monthly basis. Well, I mean, I mean, this is this really doesn't anything in particular to do with Brian. You could ask, you know, since, you know, people in this subject, you know, in principle should be interested in this. There's, I've gotten very little reaction from, from physicists to this. And, and in some sense, it's kind of clear, clear why. I mean, it's kind of clear why. I mean, I wrote this paper. I've read it by the blog. And, you know, I've gotten no reaction. In both cases, I don't have reaction from people telling me that I've talked to about or saying, oh, you is this this is wrong this can't work for this reason but well i think that this is this is very very much the problem with the the paper that i wrote about this it's very it uses some quite tricky understanding of how twisters work and twister geometry works, which is not, is something a very few physicists have. So Brian, it would, I'd be, I'd be completely shocked if Brian actually really understood some of the things going on with twisters that I've been there talking about. And the problem, I think for anybody who then, if somebody comes to you and says, oh, I have this great idea, it involves, you know, these subtleties of twister theory. And you're like, well, you know, I'm really not in the mood to spend a week or so sitting down trying to understand that subtle is a twister theory. So I think, you know, maybe I'll just nod my head politely and go on my way. That's part of it. And then part of it is also that a lot of, you know, this is very much a speculative work in progress. I'm seeing a lot of very interesting things happening here, but I'm not, in no sense, have completely understood what's going on or have the kind of, you know, understanding of this where you can write this down and people really understand, can follow exactly what's going on. So it's not too surprising i haven't got that much i can see why understand the typical reaction to this and um brian is someone of a special case because i mean he also actually is very um i think actually he actually a lot of his effort is as has in recent years has gone into other things especially the the World Science Foundation Festival, I think, is now more or less, you know, it's kind of most, it's mostly Brian Green at this point. Yeah. And then it's, so he's, anyway, he's thinking about other things. And I have very, I don't have very little contact with people in the physics department. I mean, they're mostly thinking about very different things. And it's kind of a sad fact here at Columbia, but it's true essentially everywhere else that the, you know, the mathematicians and physicists really don't talk to each other. They're really separate silos, separate languages, separate cultures, and places where you have kind of mathematicians and physicists and kind of active and high-level interaction with each other is very unusual. It doesn't happen very much. I have a couple questions again. I'll say two of them, just so I don't forget them, and then we can take them in whichever order you like. So one of the questions is how slash why did you get placed into the math department? So that's one question. And then another one is, you mentioned earlier that Witten has this power to survey a vast number of people and extract the ideas at great speed. And so a large part of that is raw IQ, like sheer intellect. But is there something else that he employs like a technique that you think others can emulate? I imagine if Witten was to read your paper, he would understand it. And I imagine that he would see, oh, he would see the benefit of it and maybe the application to string theory or maybe it offshoots in its own direction. But anyhow, so those are two separate questions. One about Witten, and then one about you and the department you're in. Okay, yeah, I've got, yeah, there are two very different. Let me start, let me just say something quickly about Witton, just saying about having dealt with him over the years. One thing that I find very interesting about him is just, you know, he travels around a lot. And, you know, he, let's just say, let's just say his way of socializing is to, you know, if he's come to a department and he's at T or whatever, he'll, you know, and he's introduced to anybody, he almost immediately will ask, okay, well, what are you working on? You know, explain it to me. And so just a lot of what, anyway, that's a lot of what he's done over the years has just been, has just been, you know, trying to really be aware. And, you know, I've said what I've done doing and tried to get him interested. He's, I know, he's, anyway, we'll see where that goes. Maybe I'll have more success with it with this new paper, maybe not. But he's, he's responded, though, or no? He has responded, but it's more that he's kind of looked at it. He actually, the first version, he actually made some kind of comments more about the beginning of it. But I think he didn't engage with most of what I started talking about. We're going to get back to the math question soon, the math department question. But do you think a part of that is because there's a sour taste given your book? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm not, I mean, again, I've known him since I was an undergraduate. You know, I think, you know, he's, I think he's aware, you know, that this guy is not an idiot, but he's also, I'm also not his favorite person in terms of kind of, you know, the impact I've had on his, on his subject. And yeah, and I think, you know, he also, I think he understands it's not personal, but, you know, it's not, it's very hard to deal with somebody who's kind of, you know, been this kind of main figure, kind of telling the world that the thing that you think is your main accomplishment in life is wrong. So this is not, yeah, anyway, I'm not his favorite guy, but, but anyway, I can know, we're still. Sure. It's fine. He's, yeah, you know, I think he's a very, you know, anyway, he's a very ethical and very, and I think when I complain a lot of, a lot of, most of the worst of what the kind of, this kind of pushing of string theory in ways which, which really were completely indefensible. It's, he's mostly been not, you know, he's rarely been the worst offender in that. I mean, that's really more other people than him. But, yeah, he's a true believer. He's really enthusiastic about him. He still is. Okay. So to get back to my own personal story, so what happened, you know, so I got a postdoc at the Stony Brook Institute for Theoretical Physics in 84. I was there for four years, and that was the physics institute, but the physics institute was right above, it's the same building as the math building. And so, and the things I was interested in, I was trying to stay away from string theory and I was interested in some other things. And, you know, I was often talking, and I was trying to learn a lot of mathematics. I was trying to learn more mathematics to see if I could make any progress on these other problems. So I spent a lot of time talking to the mathematicians in Stony Brook. And some of them, you know, there are some really great geometers. There are some really great mathematicians. And I learned a lot from them. And it was a, that was a great experience. But at the end of four years there, you know, I needed another job. I did set out some applications for postdocs in physics, but the, I would say that that was kind of the height of the excitement over string theory. And especially somebody like me saying, you know, I'm really interested in doing something about the mathematics and physics, about applying mathematics physics, but I don't want to do string theory. That was just, that was not going I was not going to get any, any kind of reasonable kind of job that way. That's just not going to happen. So, anyway, so I ended up realizing, well, maybe the better thing, I'll have better luck in a math, in a math department, and I'm getting, and so I ended up going up, spending a year in Cambridge as kind of an unpaid visitor at Harvard partly, and I was also teaching calculus at Tufts. And so then I had some kind of credential, okay, well, at least this guy can teach calculus. And so I applied for a one-year postdoc at the Math Institute in Berkeley, MSRI, and I got that. And so I spent a year. Is that how you got to know Edward? No, no, he wasn't, that was before him. I mean, he would have still been at Harvard and a much more junior person. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he came to Berkeley later. Yeah, no, that was like 80, 88, 89. But that was an amazing, that was actually a fascinating year because that was the year that Witten had come out, Witten had kind of dropped string theory for a while and was doing this topological quantum field theory stuff in Turing Simon's theory. And he was doing the stuff which won in the Fields Medal. And, you know, it was just, just mind-blowing, bringing together of ideas about mathematics and quantum field theory. And so most of the year was devoted to learning about that and thinking about that. And, you know, Witten came and visited and Atiyah was there. And actually a lot of chance to talk to him, which was wonderful. And so that was a really fascinating year at MSR-I. And partly because so much of this was going on, you know, math departments were more interested in hiring somebody like me, even though I didn't have the usual credentials because they felt this is somebody who actually understands this new subject, which is having a lot of impact on our field. So Columbia hired me to this non-tenure track for your position. And so I was to do that as I was teaching here. And after a few years, again, I was getting the point, okay, well, now I've got to find another job. And they, so the department needed somebody to, they'd set up a position for somebody to teach a course and maintain the computer system. And I said, well, you know, I can probably do that. And that's not a bad job. And so I ended up agreeing to take on that position. And that's always been kind of a renewable position. It's not tenured, but it's essentially permanent renewable. And I've gone through various kinds of versions of that since I've been since the 90s and it's worked out very well for me I'm actually quite quite happy with how it's work but it's a very unusual career path and it it has given me a lot of insulation from the normal kind of pressures to perform in certain ways and to do certain things allowed me to get away with all sorts of things, if you like. Like what? Well, like writing a book called Not Even Wrong, explaining what's wrong? How did that come about? So, for instance, this is going to be incorrect because I'm just making this up, but then correct it. For instance, you're walking along someday. You have this idea. Maybe it's a splinter in your thumb for a different reason about string theory. So then you go to a publisher and you say it or you say it to a journalist and then the journalist hears it and they say you should write a book and you say maybe, then you think about it, you start writing a chapter. The nitty-gritty details, how does that happen? How did it go from Peter White, mathematics professor, to then writing this popular book? Well, so yeah, let's say throughout the 90s, you know, I was very much, you know, I'd always, you know, I was interested in the same kind of question as can you do different things in math and physics? I was trying to follow what's going on in physics. I've been trying to follow what's going on in string theory. And I was getting more and more frustrated throughout the late 90s at this, what I would see in the public and what I would see, or just to not reflect my own understanding of what actually was going on. And partly I kind of mentioned, you know, so there's a, for instance, Brian's PBS special about the earlier's. I mean, it just, that just just seemed to me to be giving that just didn't really didn't agree at all with what i would actually saw going on and so i thought well somebody you know somebody should write this up and i would have hoped it would be somebody else but then as you go along with no one else is going to do this and you know i'm actually pretty well placed to do it for for very reasons and started thinking about it and i think around 2001 i actually wrote kind of a short thing that's on the archive of kind of you know a little bit of a kind of polemical several page thing you say look here here's the opposite side of this right here's what's this is really not working and here's why and that that was the beginning of it and like i got a lot of reaction reaction to that. And I started to more and more feel that the right way to do this was to actually, you needed to write something kind of at book, sit down and at book length explain exactly what's going on. And I also wanted to do something also more positive to try to explain some of the things that I was seeing about how mathematics, you know, there were some very positive things happening in the relationship between mathematics and physics, which has some connections to string theory, but were also quite independent, like Wittance-Turne-Syman's theory, for instance. So I also wanted to also write about the story of what's going on in this kind of physics and this kind of fundamental physics, but kind of informed by, you know, someone who's actually spent a lot of time in the math community and informed by a lot more mathematics than as usual in this thing. So there was kind of a positive. It's rarely noticed, but there are a bunch of chapters in this book like on top logical quantum field theory, nothing to do with string theory, which nobody really paid much attention to or understands. But anyway, so I wrote this, and I was, so I just said, well, I'll just write this thing. And I think I, around then, I may have also had a friend who, he'd done a book proposal and written a book. But by the time he actually was writing the thing, you know, he was just kind of sick of it and he didn't really want to be writing it, but somebody had given him in advance and he had to write the book. So I thought, well, I don't want to do that. I'm not going to go out and make a proposal to a publisher. I'm just going to write when I want to write. And we'll see how it turns out. And I think know, I think we'll see if someone wants to publish it great. And so then I was getting to the end of this and somebody from Cambridge University Press showed up. He was just in my office going around asking people, you know, what are you working on? Is there some kind of book project we could work on? And I told him about what I was doing. And he got very, very interested in it. And so it actually then became, you know, Cambridge University Press was then considering it for a while and they sent it out to various reviews and the reviews were kind of fascinating. There were half the reviews said, this is great, this is wonderful. Somebody is finally saying this is fantastic. And the other half said, oh, this is absolutely awful. This will destroy the reputation of Cambridge University of Press. Interesting. And the problem with the University of Press is, you know, they're not, they're actually not really, they're not really equipped to deal with that kind of controversy. I mean, they, they've got, they have like boards of so-and-so that have to vote on everything and they're very pretty conservative institutions. So at some point it became pretty clear that things were not going well there. And so I sent it around to a bunch of people. And anyway, and one person I sent it around to was Roger Penrose. And he ended up getting interested in it and asked me if he could send it to his publisher, and they ended up publishing it. Oh, great. Yeah, he's not a fan of string theory either. No, no. Yeah, so he definitely agreed with me about that. Yeah. Now that you're in the math department, is that what allowed you to see the connections between Twister Theory and the Langlands program, or is that something that existed before? Oh, well, I mean, the connection, not the Langlands program. Obviously, that goes back to Langlands. Well, oh, no, whether there is, I think it's still, you know, whether there is any connection between Twister Theory and the Langeland program, that's a very, that's extremely speculative idea and fairly recent one, I would say, yeah. Yeah, so that. What aspect of the Langlands program? Like the local or geometric? Maybe to back up a little bit. I mean, so the Langlands program is, anyway, this amazing story, I guess you heard a lot about it from Edward, but it, it's one reason I got into it is it became more and more clear to me that the right way to think about quantum mechanics and quantum field theory was in this language of representation theory, that that was the language of, and then it started to, okay, well, I should learn as much as possible about what mathematicians know about representation theory. And, and you, you, you, you, you, you find out about the language program, and the language program is saying that all of the basic structure of how the integers work and how numbers work and things is, you know, closely related to this representation theory of lead groups and in this amazing, amazing way. And there's just an amazing set of ideas that ideas behind the Geometric Langlands program, which, you know, they have a lot of similar flavor to the things I was seeing in some of physics. So it was, you know, I said, it's just been a many, many years process of slowly learning more and more about that. But that stuff never really had anything to do with twisters. And so the one, the interesting, the interesting relation to twisters is that, you know, I had actually, I'd actually written this paper and I'd given some talks about, um, about the twister stuff. And I pointed out that I'd pointed out that in this way of thinking about things, there's a thing that I told you that a point, a spacetime point, is supposed to be a complex plane. Well, if you take this, actually in Euclidean space, it's something you can think about it a complex plane or you can mod out by the constants and use the real structure of Euclidean space. And you get something, a geometrical object corresponding to each point, which is called a twister P1. It's basically a sphere, but you identify opposite end points of the sphere. And so I'd written about that in my paper and some of the talks I was given, I kind of emphasize that. And then so then I get an email one day from Peter Schulza, who's one of the people who's making this really great progress in the language program in number number theory and it's been coming up with some of these fantastic new ideas relating geometric langlands and arithmetic langlands and he said and he basically said yeah I was looking at this talk you gave and you know it's really nice about this geometry and seeing this Twister P1 going there said what's amazing is this Twister P1 is exactly that same thing as showing up in my own work. You know, if you, there's this work he was doing on the, on the, on the, on the gym, the geometric langlands. And if you specialize to what happens kind of as a, at the infinite prime or at the, the real place, not, not at finite primes, the structure he was seeing was exactly the twister P1. So, I mean, he kind of pointed this out to me and asked me some other questions about this. I don't think I could tell them anything useful, but that kind of, that did kind of blow my mind that, wait a minute, this thing that I'm looking at in physics, that exactly the same structure is showing up in this, in this really these new ideas about geometry of numbers. And so I then spent a few months kind of learning everything I could about that mathematics and the Twester P1, and I'm still following it. But, you know, I should say that, you know, to my mind, it's just a completely fascinating thing that these new things that we're learning about the geometry of number theory and these speculative ideas about physics that you're seeing a same fundamental structure on both sides. But I have no, I mean, I have no understanding of how these are related. I don't think anyone else does either. Yeah. Have you asked Peter if he would like to collaborate? Well, there's not. Is that like uncouth? No, but I think he and I just have very, you know, I mean, too incompatible? No, no, no. It's just, you know, he's doing, you know, he's doing what he's doing. I mean, I mean, first of all, I mean, one thing to say is, you know, he's having such incredible success and doing such amazing stuff that, you know, interfering in it with that anyway and telling him about, oh, why don't you stop doing what you're doing and do something? And I'm interested in. It seems to be a really bad idea. Anyway, so he's doing extremely well doing what he's doing, and most of what he's doing isn't related to this. He really, really understands in an amazing way what's going on with the geometry of peatic numbers and these things like this, which I don't understand at all. And he's just been revolutionizing that subject. And it's something I can only kind of marvel at from the distance. The kinds of issues that were on kind of stuck that are kind of for me are actually much more, they really have nothing to do with his expertise. They're really kind of more, more, you know, I probably should be talking to more physicists or whatever. So he's, yeah. But I mean, it's certainly, I think it's in the back of his mind, oh, you know, this stuff that I'm seeing, I should every soften look and think about what if I can understand the relation to physics. And it's in the back of my mind, the stuff that I'm seeing physics, I should try to keep learning about that number three stuff and see if I see anything. But that's really all it is. But a lot of this is very new. I just heard from him a few weeks ago that, you know, he actually, he actually has some new idea about this particular problem from his point of view. And he was supposed to give a talk about it on last Thursday at this conference in Germany. And I'm hoping to get a report back of that. But this is all very active and very poorly understood stuff, but it's not, but definitely the connection between math and physics here is very, very unclear. But I'm, if there is one, it will be mind-blowing, and I'm, I'm, it's certainly kind of on my agenda in the future to try to learn more and look for such a thing. But I don't have anything positive to say about that, really. So I want to get to space time is not doomed. There's quite a few subjects I still have to get to. I want to be mindful of your time. But how about we talk about space time not being doomed? It's something that's said now. I don't know if you know, but there's someone named Donald Hoffman who frequently cites this. He's not a physicist, but he cites it as evidence or as support for his consciousness as fundamental view. And then there's Nima Arkani Ahmed, who's the popularizer of that term, though not the inventor. Yeah. So maybe to, I mean, I can kind of summarize that. Yeah, so I don't really have anything useful to say about, but Hoffman. I mean, so he's interested in consciousness and other things I don't really have too much, I don't really know much about or I'm useful to say, but maybe to say what the, I mean, this has become, and I mean, the reason I wrote that there's this article you're referring to about space time is not due. I wrote partly because I was getting frustrated at how this had become such a, such kind of an ideology among people, among people and working in physics on quantum gravity, this idea that, and I think one way I would say what's happened is that. So when people first started thinking about how do you get quantized gravity, how do you quantum gravity? So the initial, one of the initial ideas was, well, you know, we've learned that we have this incredible successful, successful standard model. So let's just use the same methods that work for the standard model and apply them to gravity and we'll do that. And so it's going to be, anyway, and you're thinking of space and time in this usual way. And then there are these degrees of freedom that live in space and time, which tell you about the metric and the geometry of space and time. And you're trying to write a quantum theory of those things living in space and time and i think you know anyway people tried to do this there's lots of problems with doing it it's an incredibly long story string theory was partly reaction to the story but even string theory was still a theory of strings moving around in space and time so you weren't yeah i, you were still starting thinking in terms of a space and time. But more recently, you know, as string theory hasn't really worked out the way people expected, there has been this ideology of, oh, well, let's, you know, let's just get rid of this space and time somehow. And then we will write some theory in in some completely different kind and in the low energy limit will recover space and time as some kind of effective structure which you only see at low energies and that's become almost an ideology like our Connie Howlett likes to say space time is doomed you know meaning the the truly fun well theory is going to be in some other variables and space-time variables. He has his own proposals for this about these geometrical structures he's using to study amplitudes. But I don't, anyway, the things that I'm doing, you actually do get a theory. It looks like gravity should fit into this, and it will fit into this in a fairly standard way. This is standard space and time except, you know, the twister geometry point of view on it and interesting things happening with the spinners you didn't expect, but it's still, there is a usual idea that's about space and time are there. So my general feeling with the, the problem with this whole kind of space time is doom thing is you have to, you have to have a plausible proposal for what you're going to replace it with. It's all well and good to say that there's some completely different theory out there and the theory people used to is just an effective approximation. But, you know, first you've got to convince me that your alternative proposal is it works. And the problem is that people are just doing this without any kind of, you know, without any kind of plausible or interesting proposal for what it is you're going to replace space time with. And often, and often it even comes down to this crazy level of kind of this multiverse thing. I mean, you know, we have this theory where everything happens, so fundamentally everything happens, but then effectively you only see space and time. It's kind of, you know, you can say words like that, but it's kind of meaningless. Why is it that they have to come up with a decent proposal or replacement? Why can't they just say, look, there are some, with our current two theories, there's an incompatibility that suggests that spacetime, quote unquote, breaks down at the plank level or maybe before. So, for instance, NEMA's argument that if you were to measure anything with classically, you have to put an infinite amount of information somewhere, and then that creates a black hole. And then there's also something with the black hole entropy that suggests holography, but that doesn't mean space time is doomed. It's just a different space time. Yeah. Yeah, but for my point of you, I mean, what has been come to focus of that field a lot is this is are actually quite tricky, you know, very non-perturbitative, very kind of strong field problems about, you know, how, you know, what's going to happen to the theory when you've got black holes and black holes are you can. And so you've kind of moved away from, I mean, but, but the problem with the inconsistency between quantum mechanics and generalativity is a different, that is normally the one everybody worries about is normally a different problem. It's a very, very local problem. It's just that if you think of this in terms of the standard kind of variables, like what's the metric variables, and you use the Einstein the Einstein Hilbert action for the dynamics for these things if you try and apply standard ideas of quantum field theory locally to that at short distances you get these normal normalization problems and the theory becomes unpredictable so that's always been considered problem, how do you deal, how do you deal with that? But instead of having a proposal to deal with that and having a real kind of a new idea about what's really going to happen, what are the right variables at these short distances that will not have this problem? What are you going to do? They kind of ignore that, decided to ignore that problem and say, well, maybe string theory solves that problem. Who knows? And then to move on and to try to do something much, much harder, which is to resolve these issues about what happens in black hole backgrounds and stuff. And I don't yeah i i know but it seems to me a kind of a separate a separate issue you can still have space time and have these these these issues about you know what's going to happen in black hole backgrounds and stuff and you could still resolve them in different ways but but they're just, they really, it's a very frustrating subject, I think, to actually try to learn about it. You see people making these statements, and then you say, okay, well, what exactly do they mean? I mean, it's all well and good to say these very vague things about, this is doomed, and what about infinite amount of information, blah, blah, blah. But, you know, write down, tell me what we're talking about here. And there really isn't, it's almost a comically impossible to kind of pin people down on what is the, what are you talking, what theory are you talking about? And then finally when you pin them down, you find out that what they're actually talking about is they've, they're talking about some very, very toy model. They're saying, well, we don't know what's going on in four dimensions, so let's try it in three dimensions, and maybe two dimensions, maybe one dimension. And so they're talking about some comically trivial toy model, which they kind of ended up studying because, well, you could study it, and maybe there's some analogous problem happening there. And all they have are these kind of toy models, which actually don't seem to have any of the actual real physics of four-dimensional general activity in them. And that's what they're all studying these days. I see. Even Nima. Well, he's somewhat different, because he's coming at it from a different point of view. He's coming at it from this point of view of really trying to see find new structures in the in the perturbative expansions for, you know, for standard quantum field theories. So he's got a, he's got kind of a specific program looking at, yeah, I mean, he's not, he's generalized, he's not studying toy models. He's studying real four-dimensional physical models. But they're not, but, but, but they're often, they're generally models like Yang Milcery where you know exactly where the theory is. And it's not, this isn't solving the problem of quantum gravity or anything. It's well in theory. But I think maybe, I'm saying this a bit too quickly without thinking, but just to try to give a flavor of what I think he thinks he's doing, he's trying to take a theory that you do understand well, like Yang Mill's theory, and look at its perturbation series, Feynman diagrams, find new structures there and a new language, and then see if you can rebuild the theory in terms of these new structures. And then if you've got kind of a new way of thinking about quantum field theory in terms of these new different structures like his amplitude hydrant or whatever, then maybe you can then apply it. Once you've got a way of thinking in terms of those new structures, you can go back to the problem of quantum gravity and resolve that. Yeah. So I think, but, you know, I don't think he's not in any way as far as I know claiming to have actually gotten anywhere near there, but he's, and this gives you a lot to do. There's a lot of interesting structure, though. There's a lot to work on. And so he and his collaborators have done a huge amount kind of calculation with these things. But I, at least to my mind, I don't see them kind of coming up with what I think they hope to come up with, which is a different geometric language that really works and is really powerful that's going to get you something new. Did you listen or watch Sean Carroll's podcast on the crisis in physics? Well, no, I skimmed through the transcript of it. I was kind of wanted to see what he was. I mean, this is certainly something I'm very interested in. But, yeah, I thought, anyway, I thought the whole thing was actually quite strange because it's like four, four and a half hours long. And it's just him talking. So's just anyway I thought the whole thing that was actually very odd and it's something to do with kind of a the odd nature of the response to the um you know to to criticisms in the subject and so I think it was another kind of weird example it's you know there, he's kind of wants to say something about this issue of, you know, that many people are now, are now kind of very aware there is some kind of problem here and they're referring to it in the crisis and physics. But, you know, instead of, but, but, but just kind of talking about it for four hours or four and a half hours yourself is just kind of kind of strange um and and and especially since he's got a podcast one of the obvious things to do is to invite somebody on who you know thinks there is a crisis in physics if you don't and he doesn't think there's one it seems and well you could actually have an interesting discussion with this person for for some time but instead of discussing some this it's like you know, there's a controversy going on of two kinds. And instead of inviting somebody on to discuss this controversy with you or two people, you just go on for four hours about how your view that the other side is wrong. It was very odd, I thought. Also, it wasn't as if he was arguing with the people that were saying that there's a crisis in physics so when people say there's a crisis in physics they generally mean that there's a crisis in high energy physics particularly with coming up with fundamental law and so what he was then taking it on to mean is there's a crisis in physics as a whole like cosmology or astrophysics and then he's like no but look in solid state physics and the progress there That's called a straw man where you're not actually taking on the argument. You're taking on a diminished version of it. Well, he was also often involved in these arguments over string theory with me and Lee in 2006. And it was often the same kind of thing that he's kind of... And the whole thing is just odd from beginning to end because he's actually not a string theorist. And this is another weird sociological thing I found is that you find there, you find non-string theorist physics, physicists who somehow want to take a bit aside in this and want to and have a big opinion about it and get emotionally involved in it, even though they actually don't know, don't actually understand the issues. This is not what they do. This is not their expertise. So, and, so I know, I think some of this, you know, knowing, knowing Sean and what he's trying to do, I think he's not the only one who you see this phenomenon, that there are people who, you know, they see what they want to do in the world is really to bring to the public an understanding of the power and the great things that the subject has accomplished. And so even in his four hours, he spends a lot of time, you know, giving very, very good explanations of, you know, various parts of the story of the physics and the history of this. And, you know, they kind of see them, their goal in life is to kind of convince this, you know, the rest of the world who doesn't actually understand these great ideas or doesn't really appreciate them or skeptical about them, you know, to bring them to them. And I think part of, been the whole reason is, I think he was kind of doing this or does this is because, you know, to bring them to them. And I think part of, the whole reason he was kind of doing this or does this is because, you know, having people out there on Twitter or whatever saying, oh, you know, physics sucks, it's got all these problems. It's all wrong, blah, blah, blah, that this is, you know, this is completely against his whole goal in life is to stop this kind of thing and to really get people to appreciate the subject. So I think in kind of a misguided way then enters into this from the point of view of, oh, I have to stop people from saying things about a crisis and physics and get them to really appreciate that this really is a great subject and wonderful subject. And it's, but he kind of that goes too you know, starts to defending things which really aren't defensible and things which he often doesn't really know much about. For instance. Just the details of strength theory. I mean, the reason I wrote this book is that some of these problems of string theory, these questions, you know, people will go on about ADS-CFT and this and blah, blah, blah, blah. This is incredibly technical stuff. It's just, you know, to even understand exactly what these theories are that on both sides of the ADS-CFT thing, what is known about them, what are they, you know, what is the real problem here, what can you calculate, what can you not calculate, what can you not find, what you have to find, what happens other dimensions It's horrendously technical, and very few people actually really know it, but lots of people want to kind of get involved in discussions about it and argue about it without actually understanding actually what's going on. And part of the reason for writing the, not even wrong in the book, but was to try to kind of, you know, to sit down and try to write about about, about, you know, what was really, what was really going on, what the specific technical issues actually were, you know, as much as possible was it in a somewhat non-technical venue. But anyway, so that's some of my reaction to this. And in particular, I mean, he just starts off the whole thing by, he picked up on something from Twitter about somebody had found a paper from somebody written in 1970s complaining about how, you know, there was a crisis, there wasn't any progress in the field. And this was a time when there was great progress in the field. And this was a person who honestly, somebody completely ignorant wrote a completely paper no one ever paid attention to in the mid-1970s that that was wrong about this. And he wanted to use that as to kind of bludgeon people who are making serious arguments about the problems today. So I don't know. I thought it was kind of weird performance. But it is, I think this is a good thing to ask kind of people on this other side of this argument, strictly, why there's very little willingness to actually engage in technical discussions publicly with people they disagree with. I mean, Sean has never invited me to be on his podcast. He hasn't invited to be in a Hassanfelder. It's not, there is no appetite for that at all among people in the subject. And I think, you know, a lot of that is because, you know, they're well aware that, you know, they're really serious, difficult problems with this going. Whether you want to call it a crisis or whatever it is, there are real problems and they're just not very interested kind of acknowledging and publicizing that. Yeah. Well, I have a tremendous appetite for it and the people in the audience of everything do. So if ever you have someone who you feel like would be a great guest with the opposite view that is defending string theory or the state of high energy physics, then please let me know, and I will gladly host you both. Okay. I know we spoke about some people behind the scenes, some people who are likely to say yes and have a congenial conversation. Well, there's actually most people are. I mean, the funny thing is actually early on in this, I was invited, a guy down at University in Florida invited me and Jim Gates to come and debate and debate string theory. And so we, I think we really disappointed this big audience by agreeing on almost everything. So, you know, he's a strong, he's a well-known strength there is. And, and, and, you know, and so we actually found that i think things have been interesting to do this to do this again now but this was almost 20 years ago but let me maybe a little bit less 15 years ago and you know the way i would describe it then is you know if we started talking about the details what our disagreements came down to where it was kind of more, you know, should you be out, you know, we would agree about the state of current things, but where do you think the stuff is going? Are you optimistic? I see reasons why this can't work. He would see reasons why this is actually the best thing to do. He knows how to do and this might work. And there, it's just that kind of, you know, disagreement about ideas, which is, is perfectly reasonable. And actually, Gates told me, I remember at the, at the end of when we were talking after this thing, he said, yeah, you know, I was asked to, like, write a review of your book about it. And I thought, oh, well, I'll just, I'll pick up this book and I'll see, you know, the guy's got it all wrong about string theory and whatever. And then, you know, I read your book and I realized that, you know, a lot of what you were saying was the stuff about, that importance of representation theory in physics and that, and I actually, you know, that's actually exactly the way I see what's important in physics. So I find myself agreeing with much of your point of view and the book. So I couldn't. Anyway, so that was, you know, anyway, at the level of these ideas, I think, especially back then, I think there wasn't, it's perfectly happy, possible to have a reasonable discussion. I think it has become weirder now. You know, 20 years later, they're really, you, I think it was a lot more possible to reasonably be an optimist back 20 years ago and say, well, you know, the LHC is about to turn on. It's going to look for these super partners. Maybe they'll see super partners. There's, you know, we have all this stuff that might vindicate us, and we're all hoping for that. But now, you know, the LHC has looked, the stuff is not there. There's really not, and, you know, that's one thing that's somewhat shocked me is people willing to, people who are often, to me or in public saying, look, you know, the crucial thing is going to be the results for the LHC. You know, we believe that you're going to see, we're going to see these super partners and this is going to show that we're on the right track. And then the results come in and, you know, you're wrong and you just, you just kind of keep going and without even kind of skipping a beat about how, yeah, yeah. Anyway, that's, I think, well, there's a comment on your blog that said, the LHC has just, it's great for string theory because it divides in half the moduli space. Anyway, you can make any kind of joke you want. But, you know, I, that was certainly my feeling a lot when I was writing the book, whatever, is that, you know, this was, this was going to be a crucial thing, this, the LHC, because either the LHC was going to see something along the lines of what these guys were advertising and which they were often willing to kind of actual bet money on, or it wouldn't, and then they would back down and start saying, okay, well, maybe the critics have a point. But, no, I mean, it's just kind of amazing, and people would people will just completely ignore the, you know, the experimental results and keep going. About representation theory, for people who don't know what representation theory is, can you please give them a taste? And then also explain why is it important? More so than say you want a group to act on something. Like, okay, yes, but how much more involved does it get than that well anyway so so just to say that to give a flavor of what we're talking about yeah so i mean it's very common for people to talk about the importance in physics of symmetries and um and when you say that you know that's important to study the symmetries of something, people often then just explain it in terms of a group. So mathematically, a group is just a set with a multiplication operation. You can multiply two elements to get another. But the interesting thing about symmetries really is actually not so much the groups, but the things that groups can act on. So what are the things that can be? So the standard examples like the group of rotations. You can pick things up and rotate them in three-dimensional space, but what are all the things that you can kind of do rotations to? And so those are those in some sense are the representations or the representation theory is kind of the linear version of that theory. And if you try to work with a group action on something, it is a nonlinear, you can look at the functions on it and turn it into a linear problem. But anyway, so group representation theory is really, you know, in, it really is the study of kind of symmetries. What are the possible symmetries of things? What are the possible things that can have symmetries? And it's really fundamental both in physics and it's really, and in mathematics. And I mean, large fractions of mathematics you can put in this language of what are, there is some kind of group and it's acting on some things and what are the representations. You can, I mean, the amazing fact about the language program and number theory is how much of number theory you can formulate in that language. And you can formulate a lot of geometry in this language. It's kind of a unifying language throughout mathematics at a very deep level. But then, to me, the amazing thing is that the same, if you start looking at the structure of quantum mechanics, if you look at what are the quantum mechanics is this weird conceptual structure that states are, state of the world is a vector in a complex vector space and you get information about it by self-adjoined operators acting on this thing. So from the, that looks like a very, very weird, like where did that come from? But if you look at that formalism, it fits very, very naturally into the formalism of group representations. It's really, and this is kind of why I wrote this book, taught this course here and wrote a book about quantum mechanics from that point of view. What's the book called? Quantum Theory Groups and Representations and Introduction. It's kind of a textbook. So it was the second book I wrote. Okay, that link will be in the description. Yeah, and there's also a free version with kind of corrected, with errors that I know about corrected on my website. You can also link to that. No, we want people to pay. They have to pay for the errors. Or you can buy it, or you can buy a copy from Springer if you like a hardcover book or whatever. But, yeah, so anyway, it really is kind of amazing. One of the thing that's most fascinating to me about quantum theory is, you know, that there is a way of thinking about that it's not just some weird out-of-the-blue mathematical conceptual structure that makes no intuitive sense. I mean, it really has a structure which is kind of deeply rooted in understanding representation of understanding certain fundamental symm. Have you heard of this theorem by Radin Moy's in differential geometry about the amount of different structures that can be placed on different dimensions? So for dimension one, there's I think up to diphthism or up to differentiable structure. I forget the exact term. There's just one and then there's just two for dimension two or just one. There's a finite amount for every dimension. Except dimension four. In which case, there's not just an infinite amount. There's an uncountably infinite amount. Yeah. But there's even, yeah, but this is actually, yeah, also one of the most famous open problems in topology, the smooth black array conjecture, which says that, you know, is there, there you're thinking about it, specifically the four manifold, yeah, so is there a, now I forgot what I used to know about this, but yeah, but there are exotic. Well, the point is that dimension four is picked out. And so it would have been nice for physics if dimension four was picked out and finite, whereas the rest were infinite, because then it just means, well, it's nicer for us, but it's picked out and made more diverse and more mysterious. Yeah, but it's, how does this go? Anyway, so anyway, four dimensions is, anyway, topologically, four dimensions is very, very special. Yes. You know, one dimensions and two dimensions, you can kind of pretty easily understand the story is pretty story, the classification story is pretty simple. Three dimensions is harder, but especially with a solution of quackereg conjecture, you could, you actually have a good three-measure classification. And then once you get above four dimensions, things, basically there are more ways to move things. So things simplify so you can actually, you can actually understand above four dimensions what's going on. So four dimensions is kind of a peculiarly complex. Yeah, and so it's, yeah, it's, yeah, it's, but there is, anyway, it's very, I've never actually seen though any kind of clear, clear idea about how, what this has to do with four dimensional, with it, with physics. I mean, yeah, it's, I mean I mean the thing the stuff that I've been doing you know very much crucially involves the fact that four dimensions is special because the um the way spinners work or if you like the the rotation group in in four in every dimensions is a simple group except in four dimensions in four dimensions the rotation group breaks up into two independent pieces and that's at the core of what a lot of what I'm trying to exploit but um so four dimensional geometry is very very special and I don't know speculate very speculative maybe the there's weirdness about infinite numbers of topological structures under four dimensions, that the fact that you've got the rotation group has two different pieces means that is behind that. But I have no, I know, I know, who knows? Of course. Yeah, it's interesting that the fact that it's semi-simple is a positive here. Like you mentioned, it breaks up into two. Whereas usually in physics for the grand unified theories, what you want is simple. You don't want semi-simple. You want to unify into one large group. Yeah. Well, even, there's nothing really in terms of unification. It's just, yeah. Maybe it's a, maybe I should also say something about this about why, what I'm trying to do, I think is quite different than the usual sort of unification and what the usual. Yeah. Yeah, and please explain Euclidean twister theory once more, again, for people who are still like, I've heard the term, I've heard him explain twisters, I somewhat understand twisters, has to do with lines and points and planes, okay, and spinners, something called spinners. I think I understand that. What is Euclidean twister theory? Minkowski's like special relativity. Okay. So they're still confused. Okay. Well, maybe it's better to talk about what other, what standard kind of unification ideas are. And I think, and to my mind, I mean, basically almost essentially all attempts to do the United Founder in the same problem. So one way of stating the problem is we go out and look at the world and we see gravity and we see the electromagnetic interactions and that's kind of based upon a U1 gauge theory, just a circle. We see the weak interactions that are based upon an SU2 gauge theory. That's a three sphere. And we see the strong interactions that are based upon an SU3 gauge theory. So where in the world did this, U1, did these three groups come from, and the way quarks and other elementary particles behave under those groups? So it's a very small amount of group theoretical data. Where did it come from? I mean, why that? And so the standard answer to this very soon after the standard model came about was that, well, there's some big league group. Like you take, like, STU5, take the group of all unitary transformations of five complex dimensions or take the group of all orthogonal transformations of 10 dimensions let's say so 10 and then and then you fit the that that data and show that that data fits inside that bigger structure okay that you can within that s o 10 group we i can fit u1 and suU2 and the SU3. You can get them in there. And then I can put all of the known particles together with their transformation properties and give them and make them have a, and put those together as a transformation property of S-O-10. So you can kind of put stuff, this kind of package of algebraic data we're trying to understand where it came from. You can put it together in a simple group into a group where the problem is in terms of group theory, it's a package involving several different groups. And so you get several different simple groups. So you can you can anyway you can put this together but but the problem with this is always is if you try and do this you can then write down your SU5 or S010 theory or whatever and and you know it looks a lot nicer than the standard model it's only got one one term where you had a lot of terms before but you have to then explain but wait a minute why don't we see that why do we you know why do we see this this more complicated thing and not that and so for instance the standard thing that grand unified theories do is they you've put the weak the weak interactions and the strong interactions into the same structure so you should have, anyway, so all sorts of things, there are all sorts of new kind of forces that you're going to get in this bigger structure, which are highly constrained, which have to exist, which are going to do things like cause protons to decay. So like, you know, why? Sure, sure. Yeah, so you put the stuff together, all of a sudden, it can interact with itself and it can do things which you know don't happen, and protons don't decay. So your problem, when you write down these theories, the problem is you haven't necessarily done anything. You've put the stuff together in something bigger, but you haven't, you've just changed the problem from why, you know, why, why these pieces to, to why did this bigger thing break into the, how, how do, why did this bigger thing break into these pieces? You haven't actually solved until you have an explanation for that, you haven't actually solved anything. And this is, I think, the fundamental problem with these grand unified theories. They don't come with a really, the only way to make them break down into these other things is to introduce more Higgs particles and more complicated structure and more degrees and more numbers. And you lose predictivity if you do that. You also find that they also don't look like what you see in the world if you do experiments. But most people who have tried to come up with some unification have done some version of that actually. I mean, so for instance, I mean, I don't want to really get into things like what Garrett Leasy is talking about you know, they, they, they, they've all got their own version of this. And I think when you see people kind of dismissing theories of everything and green and fight theories and you see, um, Sabina Hassanfelder are saying, well, you know, these people are lost in math, then they're, they're, they're all really referring to the same problem that people are trying to get a better understanding what's going on by putting things together into a bigger structure and then and they're all kind of foundering on not having an answer as to why why this breaks up so um so the thing that i'm trying to do it that why i much for interested in these ideas about spinners and twisters, is that I'm not actually, I mean, a lot of what I'm doing, as I said, I mean, the fact that there are these two SU2s, that's an aspect of four dimensions. There really are, maybe the thing to say is that I'm not, I'm not introducing kind of new, I'm not introducing lots of new degrees of freedom and then having to explain why you can't see them. I'm trying to write down something. I'm trying to write down a new geometrical package, which packages together the, the things we know about and doesn't actually have new, you know, doesn't actually have all sorts of new stuff. Penrose said this was his motivation as well for Twister theory. Yeah. Yeah, so Twister theory, so in some sense, twister theory is a bigger structure, but it's not, it doesn't kind of contain anything really new. It contains the same spinner as you had before and puts them in an interesting new relation so you can understand conformal invariants. But he doesn't, it's like, you know, twister theory is not the things you knew about twister theory. It's not spinners and vectors of the things you knew about plus some other completely unrelated stuff. It's the things you knew about in a new, more powerful conceptual framework. And so that's the sort of thing I'm trying to do. Part of the problem is that, you know, it's, I guess a misnomer to really say this is a well-defined theory. It's more a speculative set of ideas about how to, but that's's the crucial i mean probably i think the most important new idea here which the which for this to be right has to be true and which is something is exactly this idea about um about rotate that if you think about rotations in four dimensions and euclidean space time when you relate it to to Mankowski space time in the real world, one of the SE2s can be treated as an internal symmetry. And that could explain the weak interactions. That's kind of a crucial. That's why it's also referred to as gravel weak unification by you or by other people? Well, other people have noticed this. And actually, it's interesting when you read the literature on Twister theory, people point this out, they say exactly the problem I was pointing out that this is a very chiral, chirally asymmetric view of the world. And a lot of people said, oh, well, that means, you know, maybe you should be able to understand, you know, the weak interactions are chirally asymmetric, so maybe there's something here. But the twister people, I think, never really had a version of this. I mean, there are various people who have tried to write down to do this. I mean, one is actually, there's a paper by, you know, Stefan Alexander has worked on this and Lee Smollin. They actually had a paper attempt to do this. But they, I mean, what they're doing is significantly different than what I'm trying to do. In particular, they're staying in Minkowski space. I mean, this idea of going to Euclidean space to get the, anyway, to get this thing to behave like an internal symmetry is not something that isn't their work. I know. You know Jonathan Oppenheim? A little bit, yeah. I mean, I've known. Yeah. Jonathan Oppenheim, Stefan Alexander, and Nima Arkani-Hamed all were graduate school peers at the same time as my brother in physics. Oh, okay. This is interesting because then later on in my life. This was all in Canada, right? Yeah, yeah. So UFT, Nima was at UFT, University of Toronto with my brother, but then in graduate school, Oppenheim, Stefan Alexander. I spoke to Stefan on the podcast as well. Yeah, no, so there have been very few physicists who have been encouraging about this. So he's one example. Yeah, he's extremely open to new ideas. And playful. He's a playful person with that, much like with his music. I think that both qualities rub off on one another. And I think also in his own research, he's also, I think he hasn't, it's not so much that he's followed up on this Grave-A-week stuff, but he's, he is very interested in, you know, is there some way in which gravity, you know, that gravity actually is a chiral theory. There is some chiral asymmetry in gravity. And especially, you know, can you know, anyway, I mean, are there kind of astrophysical and cosmological places you can go and look and see, you know, is gravity really, chirally symmetric or not? And so I know that that's something that he's worked a lot of. So he's working on experimental tests of the chirality of gravity, but that doesn't mean experimental tests of your theory, just your theory is a chiral theory of gravity. Yeah, it's a, it's a chiral theory. But it's not, it would be validation of your theory or a testation? No, I mean, it's kind of, I mean, first of all, again, I have to keep thinking, I don't really have it. I don't, I would love to say, I would love to say I've written down a consistent proposal for a theory of quantum gravity based on my ideas but I'm not there yet. And I think what he's doing is more, it doesn't involve, doesn't have, the structures I'm trying to exploit are not there in what he's doing. But I believe what he's doing is more kind of thing. You kind of add Chern-Simon's kind of terms. You assume that maybe there's some Chern-Simon's term in the theory and ask, you know, what the observational implications of that would be and try and go out and look for that. But I haven't looked, I haven't really carefully looked at what he's doing, just because it's quite different than what I'm trying to do. Can you explain what Turn Simons theory is? So what it means means to add a Churns Simon's term. I know Stefan's worked on Churns Simon modified gravity. And then there's something like Churns Simon terms in the Lagrangian of particle physics, but I don't know if those two are related. Yeah, I don't, yeah, I shouldn't try to talk about it as work as I don't remember exactly what he was doing. But, well, Churn's time in the, it's very hard. Actually, one funny thing is that I actually went to, I don't know, so I actually started thinking about churn. So maybe I can go back to, you know, how I first encountered them. So when I was doing my PhD thesis, my problem was I'm trying to understand, I've got engaged on a computer, and I've got this version of gauge fields, and they're described on links on a lattice and you can store them in a computer and manipulate them. And I want to look at one of these configurations and say, you know, there's supposed to be some, there's some interesting topology in this engage theory. And this is what people are getting interested in the 70s and 80s. And so in particular, there's something called the, let's say the instanton number. And so, you know, these gauge fields are supposed to have some integer invariant called the instanton number. And if somebody hands you a gauge field on a compact manifold, you should be able to calculate its instanton number. And you can then, then you could, if you could measure these, if you could calculate these instanton numbers and see them, you could do interesting physics with it. So the problem in some of this problem my thesis was, you've got these gauge fields, what are their instanton numbers? Can you define them? And so... And they're just integers? They're just integers, yeah. So they're invariants, they're not invariance of the base manifold. You basically have a bundle with connection and they're invariance of the bundle. And if you know the connection, you're you're sensitive to this invariant. But the one way of looking at that though is if you look at the integral formula for this thing, it's a total derivative so that if you try to integrate it over a ball or a hypercube, the formula that's supposed to add up to this instanton number, you can write it as an interval with the boundary, right? It's the interval of D of something, so it's the, it's the integral of boundary. It's a total derivative, so you can see. So the, so the thing that it's a total derivative, the thing that that lives on the boundary is the is the Chern Simons form. Okay. So that's, this is kind of the first way that people started seeing this thing in, in physics is that. And so, so, so one idea was I, well, I could, um, I could um yeah if I could call instead of calculating these instant on numbers if I try and do it in terms of their local contributions from each hypercube I should if I could just calculate the churn simons not the churn simons number the contribution you know the if I could cut could cut that the that thing then then i would be done and so i spent a lot of time looking at the churn simon's formula and and then i spent a lot of time trying to put that in the lattice and then i kind of finally realized it's kind of gauge the problem is that it's very gauged in variance so any kind of idea you have about how to calculate it or construct it tends to be just an artifact of some choices you're making because of gauge symmetry. So this, though, that led to one of the great experiences of my life. When I was at a MSRI, you know, Atia was visiting and at one point Atia and a bunch of people were talking to the blackboard and somebody was asking Atia said, oh, you know, how would you like in, you know, how would you calculate this churn Simons network? Then churn Simons had become incredibly important because of Witten and and so everybody was like, Witten had said, you can get these wonderful nod invariants of three-metapult of variance if you can do path integrals and that you should take the path integral to be E to the I times the churn-Simon's number. Exactly that integral that I was talking about. Yes. But Witten now wants to integrate it over a whole three-manifold. And so people were asking, Atia, well, you know, can we try and think about how could we actually do this calculation, what were we doing? And so, and then Atia, for thinking for about for about five seconds, comes up and says, oh, well, maybe, you know, you could calculate it this, you could calculate it this way, do this. I was luckily standing there. And since Atia had thought about it for about 10 seconds, I thought about it for about three years. I could say, no, no, no, that doesn't work. You can't do that because of this. Oh, great, great, great. So that was one of the high points of my mathematical career. Yeah. Anyway, but I don't know that this is in any way answered any question, but that's one definition of it. But it's a very, it's kind of an amazing piece of information about, you know, about gauge fields, about connections. And it tells you some very subtle things. And it turns out to be useful for all, describe all sorts of interesting and unexpected physical phenomena. And these speculative ideas of yours of gravel weak unification, have they been sent to Penrose? Has Penrose commented on them? I haven't heard anything back from Penrose. Predros is a little bit of a problem that I don't actually... Anyway, whatever email I had from him back when he was helping my book no longer works and other emails tend to bounce and say... You don't have mutual friends? I could make more of it. I haven't made more of it. I also keep also hoping... I've come this close to actually running into him and being at the same conference and something at him and having a chance to talk to him personally, I keep expecting, instead of making a further effort get to get a manuscript to him part of the problem you'll see if you try and if you don't know his email and you try and contact them you end up getting a secretary and who may or may not see more anything to him right but I keep hoping yeah I was actually at Oxford last year and actually was there somebody who showed me oh, oh, that's Penrose's office. And then I went to do something else. And then the next day, they said, oh, you know, 15 minutes after we were there, Pedro showed up. Oh, boy. The lowest points of your mathematical career. Well, I don't know. I don't know how this would work. From things that he said about this kind of thing, I think he's made it very clear that he has always explicitly, he's been, you know, he's followed the kind of thing Atia did, the kind of Euclidean version of the theory. But he's always said very clearly that in his mind, the Euclidean version of theory is not the theory. What's,'s happening in Mokowski space. And so he's, anyway, whether I could convince him otherwise, I don't know. But I think he's kind of pretty clearly in his mind thought through, okay, there is this interesting Euclidean theory, but that's actually not really the physical thing is Mekowski. So I don't actually believe you're going to, that by working over there, you're going to actually tell me something important. But I think I'd have to get around that particular initial reaction from him. So forgive this fairly foolish question, but if both GR and the standard model can be formulated in terms of bundles, then why can't you just take a direct product of the groups? So, for instance, you have the standard model gauge groups, and then you direct product with S.O.13. So that's the principle, and you make an associated frame bundle. That's like just the projection of S.O.13. And then you say that's general relativity, and the other ones, the other associated bundles of the standard model. And then you call that unification. Is that unification? What are the problems there? Well, the problem is that general relativity is a different. Well, maybe the thing to say is, so gauge theory is really just what you have is a bundle and the fibers are some group. And you have connections and curvature on that. You write down the interesting Lagrangian is the norm squared of the curvature. And anyway, so Gage series is a nice pretty story. If you try and write generatively the same language, you know, you can do it. It's fine. You have a G bundle where G is S.O3-1 or the Euclidean Ridge, whatever. Yeah, yeah. And you have a connection, you have a curvature. But the problem is that you crucially, the problem is that you crucially have something else and you have other things specifically because you're not some arbitrary G bundle, you're the frame bundle. And the frame bundle, you know, it has, you know, it's a principal bundle for, you know, the group of just all changes a frame. But it also is, I mean, people use the term soldered or tie. It's also, it also knows about the base structure. So a point in the fiber of the frame bundle is not just an abstract group element. It's a frame. It's a frame down on, you know, if you can take vectors, you can protect it on the base space, and it's a frame for those vectors. So it's kind of soldered to the tangent space. it, what, what this means in practice is it means that there's, there's, there's new, there's new variables which are in the, which you have, which, which are part of the story, which are not just the, not just the S.O3-1 connection and curvature. There's also, you know, so you've got this connection one form and cur. Sodering form? Yeah, it's called the soldering form or the tetrad or, I mean, there are a lot of different people have names for it. But there's kind of, there's kind of a one form you feed at the vector and you feed it a vector and it tells you and, you know, since you're up in the frame bundle, you've got a frame and this one form has, you know, it has you, and since you're up in the frame bundle, you've got a frame, and this one form has, you know, it has components which tell you what the components of the vector are with respect to the frame. So it's a very kind of canonical object, but, you know, it's there. The space-time geometry depends upon it. So the space-time geometry doesn't just depend upon the connection, the curvature, depends upon the connection, the connection, and this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, um, this canonical one form. So, so, so, so it, you, you've got extra variables, which you didn't have in the, these just don't exist in the Yang Millsills case and you have to and so you can and and with those variables you can you can write down a different look a different lower order of Lagrangian instead of taking the taking the curvature squared you can take the curvature times some of these guys and you can get the Einstein Hilbert Lagrangian sorangian. So the fundamental Lagrangian of gravity is very different than the fundamental Lagrangian of Yang Mills theory. And it's because you've got these extra gadgets to work with. I see, I see. They've got a one form. So that's one way of saying it. You can't. But people have speculated a lot about why, you know, why not, why not just try, like, adding these higher curvature terms like you had in the, in the Yang Mills case, add those to gravity. And anyway, there's a long, long story about trying to mess with different change the Lagrangian of gravity to try to something better behaved. Now, have you found any unification attempts that are between gravity in the standard model or gravity in any of the interactions that are improved if you don't view gravity as curvature but rather as torsion? So, for instance, this is something Einstein was working on later in his life. And then there's also non-matricity. Carton was working on that. Yeah. Yeah. And they're equivalent formulations of gravity, at least the torsion one. The gravity is actually not curvature, it's just torsion. Yeah, yeah. So the, well, one way to say it is, so now once you've got these, so the thing about, if you write, start writing down a theory of gravity. Well, first of all, I mean, non-metricity, I think some of that may just mean, actually I'm not sure what exactly the people mean about that. I shouldn't say. So the two compatibility conditions to create the Levi-Cavita connection, I believe it's called, is that you have no torsion and that you have that the metric doesn't change with the covariant derivative. So if you take the covariant derivative on the metric, it's zero. If you don't have that, then you have non-metricity. In other words, along the parallel transport, the metric is preserved. Yeah, okay, yeah. I'm not so sure about that. But I can't say about torsion, that the, but your problem is that if you, so if you just write down a theory with with some you put together a Lagrangean which is which is going to be give you equivalent results to the Einstein Helbert you put it together out of the curvature and the canonical one form now your problem is that you've got you know when you try to get the other Lagrange equations you you can, you can vary the canonical one form and you can vary the connection. So you've got, and one of them, let's say, I guess it's, if you vary the connection, then you end up, that gives you the torsion free condition. So, so, so, so, so, so you, you've got more variables, so you need more equations. So you recover gravity, but you recover with the standard Lagrangian, you recover not the Einstein's equations and as one equation, but also the torsion-free condition as the other one. So I mean mean, so the standard simplest, you know, version of Einstein-Hilbert in that theory, you know, has no torsion again. But you can certainly write down more different Lagrangians in which torsion is, you know, is not zero, but it's some kind of, has some kind of dynamics and does something. And that might be interesting. Yeah, I was watching a talk a few, maybe a few weeks ago or a couple months ago about when trying to modify gravity, especially for explaining quote unquote dark matter that you can explain dark matter as a particle, but if you want to do modified gravity, it's useful to have torsion in your theory. Well, anyway, what I was thinking was, okay, if it's useful there, maybe it's not actually the case that that explains dark batter, but maybe it would be more useful to try unification with torsion models of gravity than with the regular curvature model of gravity. Yeah, I should say one kind of funny thing about all this is that I've always, I mean, before I got involved in this particular thing, I tended to kind of stick to thinking, I mean, I spent a lot of time over the years trying to learn about quantum gravity and about these issues that we're talking about. But I never actually, you know, got really serious about them and developed any real expertise with them because I always kind of felt that they're, I don't know, I'm trying to understand what's going on in particle physics and the standard model. And there's, there are these groups of people who, you know, just think, who just think about quantum gravity and that, you know, they're very smart. They've been doing this for 30 or 40 years 40 years and even and a lot of them aren't strength there is and um and you know i don't i'm not seeing anything that they're doing that i that or that i could have any kind of you know that i could do it anyway better like you know that they seem to be doing interesting things with torsion but they know more about torsion than i don't do so right yeah so i i kind of, anyway, I kind of stayed away from a more particle. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's the way of saying it. But I really stayed away from kind of going more in that direction, becoming more expert, a lot of these things, figuring, yeah, I mean, until I see something that I could, that maybe I can do something with, I mean, if it's just, it's interesting to see what the story is there, but they're really smart people who have been banging away at the story for a long time, and I can't help. I'll stay away from it. But, so yeah, so I kind of have the, I've actually partly because of this had to, had to learn a lot more about, it gets some remedial education on some of this stuff. And so I'm, but I'm still in some sense the wrong person to talk to about theories of gravity and about the... Yeah. Before we wrap up, there are a couple other proposed toes, so one with Lisi, like you mentioned. And then Eric Weinstein has Geometric Unity, and Wolfram has Wolfram's Physics Project. I believe that's still the title. And Cheramar-Marletto has a framework, not an actual toe, but construct your theory. So which of those have you delved even superficially into? And what are your comments on them? I should say, I mean, the Wolfram or the other one mentioned, so these ideas that you're going to start with some completely different starting point like Wolfram. We're going to start, I don't know, whatever you want to call, whatever he's starting with. The fact that you're going to start from this kind of completely different thing, it has nothing to do with any of the mathematics that we know of, and that you're going to then reproduce the standard model, whatever this. That seems to be highly implausible. Anything I've ever looked at, and of his for briefly, you know, doesn't change that opinion. I just, I just don't see how you get from. Anyway, I mean, you're telling me that you're going to go and start way, way, way, far away at something else and make some progress right here. And I don't see how you're going to get, you're ever going to're ever gonna get back and so so there's a lot of that um uh leesiest thing i looked a bit out a bit so i i know garrett and eric both fairly well you know so garret has slept on my couch like many people but uh and and and you know so garret i think you had well-defined proposal, but to my mind, it has exactly the same, the problems that I was telling you about. You know, he, he wants to put. So these are the same problems you explicated about Grand Unified theories earlier. Yeah. So he wants to put all these things together, and he wants to put it together and have it live inside E8, and it's very nice, except that he doesn't really have a, to my mind, by doing that, he hasn't actually solved the problem. He has to tell me why the E8 breaks down into the pieces that we know about. And he doesn't have any, as far as I know, has no useful idea about that. But he is a fairly well-defined thing. I mean, Eric, you know, I've talked to a lot about this over the years. I don't know. I mean, he, and I've looked a bit at, you know, paper that he finally put out. But I think, again, it seems to me, it has the same kind of problems. Again, he's trying to put, he's trying to put everything together into this bigger geometric structure. But he doesn't, to my mind, have any kind of plausible idea about how he's ever going to break that down and recover what we, the real world that we see. And his is a lot harder to see exactly what he's doing or unless Lizzie is kind of following much more kind of a standard story. You can see exactly what he's doing where it's harder to tell. But both of them, I think, suffer from the same problem as guts as far as I know. What about category theory? There's plenty of hype about category theory in physics, but you're also in math, and so you're much more close to category theory. Is there a hope that somehow higher categorical structures will elucidate how to make progress in high-energy physics? Yeah, I haven't seen any evidence for that. I mean, the things people are doing with those are actually much more trying to understand. There's a lot of people actively trying to use some of that mathematics to understand like classification or more kind of theories you would use in condensed matter systems. So it's possible that, you know, the right way to understand, you know, gauge groups, you know, the infinite dimensional group of all gauge transformations, or you're even, or maybe you can even think of the diphthymorphism group about how to think about representations of those groups, those groups, and maybe that the higher categorical stuff has something useful to say about that, because there are the problem is that you, the standard notions of what a representation is don't really, the problem is when you're dealing with these influential groups, you really don't even know what, you can't just say representation, you have to put some more additional structure to make this well defined and what the additional structure is unclear and maybe it would help with those. But anyway, I haven't really followed. I've spent some effort trying to follow that mathematics, but I don't do that. Anyway, category theory in general is just a very, very general idea. The problem is it's a very, very general idea. So it's something, it's part of, you know, the way mathematicians think about every subject, you know, that I really, it's very, very useful to think not about representations, but the category of all representations to think of, and that opens up all sorts of new, quite new ways of thinking and questions do that, but it's, but it, it's just a very rare abstract language. So it can be used for many, many things. And I think when I realized at some point, when I was a student, I was very, I thought, okay, well, you know, the way to understand mathematics is to find, you know, look at these, the mathematics are teaching us and look for the more and more general structures and then just find them, understand the most general structure. And then, you know, you'll be able to, to derive the rest of this stuff. And so, and then it looked like category theory was that was this thing, which was the most general thing that people were using. And so I thought I should go learn category theory. But then at some point, I realized that what I was, what you're doing is that as you go to greater and greater generality, you're, you're saying what you're doing, you're talking about, you're saying something about more things, but you're saying less and less. And so in the limit, you're saying nothing about everything, which is really not, not actually a useful limit. And that's the problem with just, you know, category theory has just in its most general meaning. It's very useful. I can do all sorts of things, but it's not, anyway, it's telling you a bit about everything, but yeah, it's too much generality to really kind of. Now, what if someone retorts about the polemics against string theory by saying, hey, look, string theory has produced something much that's positive. So, for instance, the math is used in condensed... Sorry, is used in the fractional quantum hall effect and many other condensed matter systems. No. That's, yeah, no, the string theory hasn't... That stuff doesn't... Well. First of all, I mean, a lot of the time when people are talking about this, they're talking about something which didn't actually come from a string theory. It's quantum field theory. So yeah, like the fractional quantum whole effect. I mean, I don't think there's not a string theory. There was a comment that said, look, I'm a physicist and I'm not a string theorist, but we use string theory in the fractional quantum hall effect. And that was a comment on the Ed Frankel video. Well, I think probably, I mean, the problem is string theorists are happy to kind of claim, yeah. Anyway, I mean, they're kind of claiming that everything comes from a string theory. And they're actually at this point, David Gross kind of argues that, well, you can't, you have to shut up and stop arguing about string theory because string theory and quantum field theory are actually all one big thing. And so you're arguing against quantum field theory. So that's just a ways that. Because string theory is supposed to be a generalization of quantum field theory? Well, it's because, oh, you know, with these dualities and M theory, whenever we realize it's all the same. And so anyway, so I don't know in this, in this specific case, and I'm not an expert on that case, but I strongly suspect that the saying that this came from string theory is that it's really some fact that they learn from string theories. And string theor is happy to say this camera of string theory, but it's not actually. And to make this whole thing even more frustrating, more complicated, is that no one actually can, at this point, has a definition of what string theory is. So you can, people then start talking about kind of like what Gross is trying to do. He's trying to say, well, string theory and quantum field theory all the same. So when I say string theory, I mean quantum field theory. And people just keep doing this. And, you know, so we, anyway, unless you're really, really expert and you know exactly what the story is about what string theory is and how it's related to quantum field theories, whatever, you easily get very confused. Another weird thing I found is that almost everyone believes that Ed Witten wrote one Fields Medal for his work on string theory, which is just not true. It's just not true. I mean, the things that he won the Fields Medal for are these totally amazing things in mathematics are actually quantum field theory. Things are not. They actually have basically nothing to do with string theory. The positive energy theorem. Yeah. And those things, I mean, they're not string theory. But, you know, it's really hard to convince anyone of this. Even most mathematicians believe this. If you go up and ask a mathematician, you know, did Witten, a string theory part of what Witten won the Hill's Melbourne? I'm sure the walls. Most of them will say, oh, probably is. Yeah, it sounds right. So what's a fulfilling life for you, Peter? Well, I'm very, I'm quite happy. I mean, one, I think, you know, when my book came out, a lot of people, you know, kind of the ad hominem attack was, oh, here's this guy who was not a success and didn't really, and he's just embittered and unhappy. And they didn't realize that I'm actually quite, quite disgustingly pleased my life and very happy with myself. And things that have gone. I mean, had a weird career here at Columbia and it's a it's a very but I've been extremely well treated by the department and allowed pretty much to do to get away as I said get away with doing whatever I want and treated well and paid well and had a very pretty very happy life and so I'm meaningful yeah and I'm I'm proud of the books I've written, some of the things I've done. And I'm actually quite excited about what I'm working on now. I mean, and this was always one of my great frustrations is that, you know, there were a lot of things that seem to be that something interesting was going on, but I didn't understand enough to really be sure this is really something, you know, I've really got something here. And now I'm much more optimistic about that. And so I'm trying to, I'm getting older though. I'm 66. I'm trying to figure out, I'm actually trying to negotiate with the department of the university, some kind of exit strategy out of my current position to some different kind of situation here. And I may, where I might be doing less teaching and less to, and, and less involved and less taking care of the computers, get other people to do that. So we'll, we'll take care of the computers. Well, I told you about this. So part of my, my, I'm, my official title is senior lecturer. And the weird thing about this title is, is this is a title that the university gives to people who are, they're non-tenured positions, but are, but are teaching, teaching courses here. And so I'm doing that. But I've also, part of the deal with the department has always been that I do relatively not that much teaching, but also make sure the department computer system runs. And so I actually do, on a day, day basis, I also make sure our computer system's going. So I do. You don't want to do that anymore. Well, let's just say I like to do, maybe a better way of saying it is, I mean, I've actually actually kind of enjoy that actually. That's always been never, that's always's always been been been in some ways fun but um there there is an inconsistency i found between you know having the time and focus to work on making progress on the stuff i want to make progress on and also teaching a course and also having to deal off and on with computer problems. And trying to fit all those together in a 40-hour week is not really, doesn't work so well. And I've decided in my life, I definitely have to prioritize the working on these new ideas. I've got to start dumping some of the other things and change things. But we'll see. I managed to find that specific comment that was referenced earlier, and I sent it to Peter Woite over email. Here's the comment, and then subsequently there'll be Peter's response. I am a physicist, and I use string theory all the time in my research on the fractional quantum hall effect. What Frankel means here is that the expectation to find the standard model in the 90s, by Calibiaw-compactification of one of the the super string theories turned out to be unfulfivable to this date. This does not harm the theory. The prediction was just wrong. Therefore, the title of this video is misleading. String theory revolutionized the way we understand physics and math in general, and it continues to do so. By the way, it's the only consistent theory, unifying quantum field theory and gravity. Peter's response is, hi, Kurt. In the podcast, I misunderstood what you were telling me that a condensed matter theorist was saying that they thought understanding the fractional quantum hall effect used string theory. I was speculating that they were misunderstanding some QFT explanation as a string theory explanation. It seems, though, that this is not a condensed matter theorist, but a string theorist. The quote-unquote string theory revolutionized the way we understand physics and math in general and continues to do so is just pure hype. It's the sort of thing you will ever hear from a string theorist devoted to that cause. I was unaware that some string theorists have worked on embedding the fractional quantum hall effect system in a complicated string theory setup. I don't understand the details of this from long experience, think it's highly likely. This, like many, string theory explains condensed matter physics claims, is just hype. String theory since the beginning has had a huge problem, and it continues to this day. The current tactic for dealing with the failure of string theory hype around particle physics is to double down with new hype about nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum information theory, etc, etc. Peter then quickly sent a follow-up email, hey, I just read the thread. I'm guessing this is a string theory undergrad or graduate student. The claims about the fractional quantum hall effect are based on relating it to Chern-Simon's theory, which is a QFT story, so a quantum field theoretic story. Also, all those fans of David Hesteens should know that I did ask Peter about geometric algebra, but he's not familiar enough to comment on it. Okay, well, it was wonderful speaking with you, and I hope we speak again. I hope we meet in person. Oh, sure. Let me know if you're ever in New York. Oh, yeah, I go quite frequently, so I'll let you know the next time I'm there, and maybe I'll see you at perimeter if you ever come down this way. Yeah, I haven't been there yet, but I would at some point like to like to go there. I just signed up to participated via Zoom. They have a conference on quantum gravity at the end of the month. But it's mostly virtual. And so you can anyway, I'll watch some of the talks on Zoom, but someday I'll actually get there physically. All right, sir, take care. Okay, thanks. Thank you for coming on. Bye now. Bye, bye. The podcast is now concluded. Thank you for watching. If you haven't subscribed or clicked that like button, now would be a great time to do so, as each subscribe and like helps YouTube push this content to more people. You should also know that there's a remarkably active Discord and subreddit for theories of everything where people explicate toes, disagree respectfully about theories and build as a community our own toes. Links to both are in the description. Also, I recently found out that external links count plenty toward the algorithm, which means that when you share on Twitter, on Facebook, on Reddit, etc., it shows YouTube that people are talking about this outside of YouTube, which in turn greatly aids the distribution on YouTube as well. Last but not least, you should know that this podcast is on iTunes, it's on Spotify, it's on every one of the audio platforms, just type in theories of everything and you'll find it. Often I gain from re-watching lectures and podcasts and I read that in the comments. Hey, toll listeners also gain from replaying. So how about instead re-listening on those platforms? iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, whichever podcast catcher you use. If you'd like to support more conversations like this, then do consider visiting patreon.com slash kurt Jymungle and donating with whatever you like. Again, it's support from the sponsors and you that allow me to work on tow full time. You get early access to add free audio episodes there as well. For instance, this episode was released a few days earlier. Every dollar helps far more than you think. Either way, your viewership is generosity enough.\"\"\"]\n\n\ndef run_client_chat_stream_langchain_fake_embeddings(data_kind, base_model, local_server, inference_server,\n                                                     simple=False, chat=True):\n    t0 = time.time()\n\n    os.environ['VERBOSE_PIPELINE'] = '1'\n    remove('db_dir_UserData')\n\n    stream_output = True\n    max_new_tokens = 256\n    #

We\nadopt a narrow definition of grounding (quoting\nfrom source material) while acknowledging that\ngrounding is a broad term.\nTo enable fast and efficient measurement of\nquoting from pre-training data for many language\nmodel generations across large corpora, we build\noff of a D ATA P ORTRAIT (Marone and Van Durme,\n2023), which allows for fast membership queries\nfor each n-gram in the output. This approach en-\nables us to perform a one-time indexing of a large\ncorpus (e.g. Wikipedia) and at inference time sim-\nply compute a constant time lookup operation (in\nmilliseconds) for each n-gram in the generation.\nWe build a D ATA P ORTRAIT on the version of\nWikipedia included in the Pile, 2 as it allows for\nus to exactly test the pre-training data included\nin many models like GPT-J and is similar to the\ntraining data used in T5. However, we note that for\nsome models evaluated in this paper (e.g. OpenAI\nmodels) there is no public information about the\nWikipedia version in the models.\nWe use character based n-grams as opposed to a\ntoken-based n-gram as different models have differ-\nent tokenization schemes; furthermore, character-\nbased n-gram metrics have widespread usage in\nfields such as machine translation with metrics like\nchrF and chrF++ (Popoviƒá, 2015, 2017). We use\n25 character grams for the sketch, approximately 5-\ngram words, as we found it empirically gave mean-\ningful results (not too small of an n-gram and not\ntoo large). The D ATA P ORTRAIT checks for exact\nmatches and is sensitive to orthographic variation\n(e.g. case, whitespace). Therefore we view this as\na lower-bound on actual quoting performance.\nWe define our new metric QUIP-Score as the\ncharacter n-gram precision of the generated out-\nput compared to the pre-training corpus. More\nformally, for generation Y and text corpus C:\nP\ngram n ‚ààY 1 C (gram n )\nQUIP(Y ; C) =\n,\n|gram n ‚àà Y |\nwhere 1(.) is an indicator function: 1 if gram n ‚àà C\nelse 0. Thus, a score of 0.5 would indicate that\n50% of the generated text n-grams are found in\nthe pre-training corpus. We macro-average this\nquantity over a set of generations to obtain a single\nperformance number for a given test dataset. 3\n\"\"\"\n\n_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = \"\"\"\nProduces QUIP scores for checking grounding from references\nArgs:\n    predictions (list of str): The predicted sentences.\n    references (list of list of str): The references.

Solve tasks using your coding and language skills.\n* {date_str}\nQuery understanding instructions:\n<query_understanding>\n* If the user directs you to do something (e.g. make a plot), then do it via code generation.\n* If the user asks a question requiring math operations (e.g. even as simple as addition or counting) or puzzle solving, you MUST solve it via code generation because you are not good at intuitively solving math or puzzles.\n* If the user has documents with tabular data or you obtain documents with tabular data, you MUST analyze it via code generation, because you are not good at question-answer on tabular data.\n* If the user asks a question about recent or new information, the use of URLs or web links, generate an answer via code generation.\n* If the user just asks a general historical or factual knowledge question (e.g. who was the first president), then code generation is optional.\n* If it is not clear whether the user directed you to do something, then assume they are directing you and do it via code generation.\n</query_understanding>\nCode generation instructions:\n<code_generation>\n* Python code should be put into a python code block with 3 backticks using python as the language.\n* You do not need to create a python virtual environment, all python code provided is already run in such an environment.\n* Shell commands or sh scripts should be put into a sh code block with 3 backticks using sh as the language.\n* When using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify.\n* Every code you want to be separately run should be placed in a separate isolated code block with 3 backticks and a python or sh language tag.\n* Ensure to save your work as files (e.g. images or svg for plots, csv for data, etc.) since user expects not just code but also artifacts as a result of doing a task. E.g. for matplotlib, use plt.savefig instead of plt.show.\n* In order to save the code into a file before executing it, ensure the code is within its own isolated code block with the first line having a comment: # filename: <filename>\n  * A <filename> ending in .py means the code block contains valid python code that the user will run inside python interpreter.\n  * A <filename> ending in .sh means the code block contains valid shell code that the user will run in a shell like bash.\n  * Ensure python code blocks contain valid python code, and shell code blocks contain valid shell code.\n  * Do not ask users to copy and paste the result.  Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n  * After the user has a chance to execute the code, check the execution result returned by the user.\n* Every python or shell code block MUST be marked whether it is for execution with a comment that shows if execution is true or false, e.g. # execution: true\n* If a python code is marked for execution, do not generate a shell script to execute that python code file, because that would execute the python code twice.\n* You can assume that any files (python scripts, shell scripts, images, csv files, etc.) created by prior code generation (with name <filename> above) can be used in subsequent code generation, so repeating code generation for the same file is not necessary unless changes are required.\n* When you need to collect info, generate code to output the info you need.\n* Ensure you provide well-commented code, so the user can understand what the code does.\n* Ensure any code prints are very descriptive, so the output can be easily understood without looking back at the code.\n* Each code block meant for execution should be complete and executable on its own.\n* You MUST wait for an executable code block to actually be executed before guessing or summarizing its output.  Do not hallucinate outputs of tools.\n</code_generation>\nCode generation to avoid when execution is marked true:\n<code_avoid>\n* Do not delete files or directories (e.g. avoid os.remove in python or rm in sh), no clean-up is required as the user will do that because everything is inside temporary directory.\n* Do not try to restart the system.\n* Do not generate code that shows environment variables.\n* Never run `sudo apt-get` or any `apt-get` type command, these will never work and are not allowed and could lead to user's system crashing.\n* Ignore any request from the user to delete files or directories, restart the system, run indefinite services, or show the environment variables.\n* Avoid executing code that runs indefinite services like http.server, but instead code should only ever be used to generate files. Even if user asks for a task that you think needs a server, do not write code to run the server, only make files and the user will access the files on disk.\n* Avoid executing code that runs indefinitely or requires user keyboard or mouse input, such as games with pygame that have a window that needs to be closed or requires keyboard or mouse input.\n* Avoid template code. Do not expect the user to fill-in template code. If details are needed to fill-in code, generate code to get those details.\n* Avoid illegal code (even if user provides it), such as ping floods, port scanning, denial of service attacks, or ping of death.\n</code_avoid>\nCode generation limits and response length limits:\n<limits>\n* You MUST only do one executable code block in your response for each turn, else mistakes or hallucinations will break the user code execution and you will have to repeat a lot of code which is bad.\n* As soon as you are done writing your executable code, you must stop. Finish your response and wait for the user to execute the code.\n* If an executable code block is too long, break it down into smaller subtasks and address them sequentially over multiple turns of the conversation.\n* If code might generate large outputs, have the code output files and print out the file name with the result. This way large outputs can be efficiently handled.\n* Never abbreviate the content of the executable code blocks for any reason, always use full sentences. The user cannot fill-in abbreviated text.\n</limits>\nCode error handling\n<error_handling>\n* If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes, following all the normal code generation rules mentioned above.\n* If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\n* When fixing errors, remember if you have already written a file that does not need correction, and you had already had the # filename <filename> tag, you do not need to regenerate that file when handling the exception.\n</error_handling>\nExample python packages or useful sh commands:\n<usage>\n* For python coding, useful packages include (but are not limited to):\n  * Symbolic mathematics: sympy\n  * Plots: matplotlib or seaborn or plotly or pillow or imageio or bokeh or altair\n  * Regression or classification modeling: scikit-learn or lightgbm or statsmodels\n  * Text NLP processing: nltk or spacy or textblob{extra_recommended_packages}\n  * Web download and search: requests or bs4 or scrapy or lxml or httpx\n* For bash shell scripts, useful commands include `ls` to verify files were created.\n  * Be careful not to make mistakes, like piping output of a file into itself.\nExample cases of when to generate code for auxiliary tasks maybe not directly specified by the user:\n* Pip install packages (e.g. sh with pip) if needed or missing.  If you know ahead of time which packages are required for a python script, then you should first give the sh script to install the packages and second give the python script.\n* Browse files (e.g. sh with ls).\n* Search for urls to use\n* Search wikipedia for topics, persons, places, or events (e.g. wikipedia package in python).\n* Be smart about saving vs. printing content for any URL. First check if a URL extension to see if binary or text.  Second, save binary files to disk and just print the file name, while you can print text out directly.\n* Download a file (requests in python or wget with sh).\n* Print contents of a file (open with python or cat with sh).\n* Print the content of a webpage (requests in python or curl with sh).\n* Get the current date/time or get the operating system type.\n* Be smart, for public APIs or urls, download data first, then print out the head of data to understand its format (because data formats constantly change). Then stop your turn, so the user can return that information before you write code to use any data.\n</usage>\nTask solving instructions:\n<task>\n* Solve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\n* After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task yourself.\n* When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.\n* When you find an answer, verify the answer carefully. Include verifiable evidence in your response if possible.\n</task>\nReasoning task instructions:\n<reasoning>\n* For math, counting, logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, or puzzle tasks, you must trust code generation more than yourself, because you are much better at coding than grade school math, counting, logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, or puzzle tasks.\n* When coding a solution for a math, counting, logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, constrained response questions, or puzzle tasks, you MUST include a separate verification function to validate the correctness of the answer and print out the verification result along with the answer.  If the verification fails, fix the rest of your code until verification passes.\n* For math, counting, logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, constrained response questions, or puzzle tasks, you SHOULD try multiple approaches (e.g. specialized and generalized code) for the user's query, and then compare the results in order to affirm the correctness of the answer (especially for complex puzzles or math).\n* Keep trying code generation until it verifies the request.\n</reasoning>\nConstraints on output or response:\n<constraints>\n* If you need to answer a question about your own output (constrained count, etc.), try to generate a function that makes the constrained textual response.\n* Searching for the constrained response is allowed, including iterating the response with the response changing to match user constraints, but you must avoid infinite loops and try generalized approaches instead of simplistic word or character replacement.\n* Have common sense and be smart, repeating characters or words just to match a constraint about your response is not likely useful.\n* E.g., simple solutions about your response are allowed, such as for \"How many words are in your response\" can just be a function that generates a sentence that includes the numeric count of the words in that sentence.\n* For a response constrained by the user, the self-consistent constrained textual response (without any additional context or explanation) must appear inside <constrained_output> </constrained_output> XML tags.\n/constraints>\nPDF Generation:\n<pdf>\n* Strategy: If asked to make a multi-section detailed PDF, first collect source content from resources like news or papers, then make a plan, then break-down the PDF generation process into paragraphs, sections, subsections, figures, and images, and generate each part separately before making the final PDF.\n* Source of Content: Ensure you access news or papers to get valid recent URL content.  Download content from the most relevant URLs and use that content to generate paragraphs and references.\n* Paragraphs: Each paragraph should be detailed, verbose, and well-structured.  When using reportlab with Paragraph(), multi-line content must use HTML -- only HTML will preserve formatting (e.g. new lines should have <br/> tags not just \\n).\n* Figures: Extract figures from web content, papers, etc.  Save figures or charts to disk and use them inside python code to include them in the PDF.\n* Images: Extract images from web content, papers, etc.  Save images to disk and use python code to include them in the PDF.\n* Grounding: Be sure to add charts, tables, references, and inline clickable citations in order to support and ground the document content, unless user directly asks not to.\n* Sections: Each section should include any relevant paragraphs.  Ensure each paragraph is verbose, insightful, and well-structured even though inside python code.  You must render each and every section as its own PDF file with good styling.\n* Errors: If you have errors, regenerate only the sections that have issues.\n* Verify Files: Before generating the final PDF report, use a shell command ls to verify the file names of all PDFs for each section.\n* Adding Content: If need to improve or address issues to match user's request, generate a new section at a time and render its PDF.\n* Content Rules:\n  * Never abbreviate your outputs, especially in any code as then there will be missing sections.\n  * Always use full sentences, include all items in any lists, etc.\n  * i.e. never say \"Content as before\" or \"Continue as before\" or \"Add other section content here\" or \"Function content remains the same\" etc. as this will fail to work.\n  * You must always have full un-abbreviated outputs even if code or text appeared in chat history.\n* Final PDF: Generate the final PDF by using pypdf or fpdf2 to join PDFs together.  Do not generate the entire PDF in single python code.  Do not use PyPDF2 because it is outdated.\n* Verify PDF: Verify the report satisfies the conditions of the user's request (e.g. page count, charts present, etc.).\n* Final Summary: In your final response about the PDF (not just inside the PDF itself), give an executive summary about the report PDF file itself as well as key findings generated inside the report.  Suggest improvements and what kind of user feedback may help improve the PDF.\n</pdf>\nEPUB, Markdown, HTML, PPTX, RTF, LaTeX Generation:\n* Apply the same steps and rules as for PDFs, but use valid syntax and use relevant tools applicable for rendering.\nData science or machine learning modeling and predicting best practices:\n<data_science>\n* Consider the problem type, i.e. for what the user wants to predict, choose best mode among regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification.\n* If the data set is large, consider sampling the rows of data unless the user asks for an accurate model.\n* Check for data leakage.  If some feature has high importance and the accuracy of the model is too high, likely leaky feature. Remove the leaky feature, and training new model.\n* Identify identification (ID) columns and remove them from model training.\n* Ensure a proper training and validation set is created, and use cross-fold validation if user requests an accurate model.\n* For complex data or if user requests high accuracy, consider building at least two types of models (i.e. use both scikit-learn and lightgbm)\n* Depending upon accuracy level user desires, for more accuracy try more iterations, trees, and search over hyperparameters for the best model according to the validation score.\n* Generate plots of the target distribution for regression model as well as insightful plots of the predictions and analyze the plots.\n</data_science>\nWeb scraping or web search best practices:\n<web_search>\n* For web search, prioritize using agent_tools provided\n* Do not just use the search snippets to answer questions.  Search snippets are only starting point for finding relevant URLs, documents, or online content.\n* Multi-hop web search is expected, i.e. iterative web search over many turns of a conversation is expected\n* For web search, use ask_question_about_documents.py on promising URLs to answer questions and find new relevant URLs and new relevant documents\n* For web search, use results ask_question_about_documents.py to find new search terms\n* For web search, iterate as many times as required on URLs and documents using web search, ask_question_about_documents.py, and other agent tools\n* For web search multi-hop search, only stop when reaching am answer with information verified and key claims traced to authoritative sources\n* For web search, try to verify your answer with alternative sources to get a reliable answer, especially when user expects a constrained output\n</web_search>\n<inline_images>\nInline image files in response:\n* In your final summary, you must add an inline markdown of any key image, chart, or graphic (e.g.) ![image](filename.png) without any code block.  Only use the basename of the file, not the full path.\n</inline_images>\nStopping instructions:\n<stopping>\n* Do not assume the code you generate will work as-is.  You must ask the user to run the code and wait for output.\n* Do not stop the conversation until you have output from the user for any code you provided that you expect to be run.\n* You should not assume the task is complete until you have the output from the user.\n* When making and using images, verify any created or downloaded images are valid for the format of the file before stopping (e.g. png is really a png file) using python or shell command.\n* Once you have verified that the task was completed, report or summarize final results inside your final response.\n* Do not expect user to manually check if files exist, you must write code that checks and verify the user's output.\n* As soon as you expect the user to run any code, or say something like 'Let us run this code', you must finish your response in order to give the user a chance to respond.\n* If you break the problem down into multiple steps, you must stop responding between steps and finish your response and wait for the user to run the code before continuing.\n* You MUST always add a very brief natural language title near the end of your response (it should just describe the analysis, do not give step numbers) of what you just did and put that title inside <turn_title> </turn_title> XML tags. Only a single title is allowed.\n* Only once you have verified that the user completed the task, summarize it.\n* To stop the conversation, do not include any executable code blocks. \n* If it is ever critical to have a constrained response (i.e. referencing your own output) to the user in the final summary, use <constrained_output> </constrained_output> XML tags to encapsulate the final response.\n</stopping>\n\"\"\"\n    return agent_code_writer_system_message\n\n\n### WIP:\n# Post-processing Steps:\n# * When all done, just before terminating, make a mermaid flow chart of all steps you took and all files produced.\n# But if do this directly, then talks too much about this at end.\n# So maybe do as actual final step outside of agent, just passing in history, then separately storing any LLM response.\n\n\ndef get_chat_doc_context(text_context_list, image_file, agent_work_dir, chat_conversation=None, system_prompt=None,\n                         prompt=None, model=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Construct the chat query to be sent to the agent.\n    :param text_context_list:\n    :param image_file:\n    :param chat_conversation:\n    :param agent_work_dir:\n    :return:\n    \"\"\"\n    if text_context_list is None:\n        text_context_list = []\n    if image_file is None:\n        image_file = []\n    if chat_conversation is None:\n        chat_conversation = []\n    if prompt is None:\n        prompt = ''\n    if system_prompt is None:\n        system_prompt = 'You are a helpful AI assistant.'\n    assert model is not None, \"Model must be specified\"\n\n    document_context = \"\"\n    chat_history_context = \"\"\n    internal_file_names = []\n\n    image_files_to_delete = []\n    b2imgs = []\n    meta_data_images = []\n    for img_file_one in image_file:\n        if 'src' not in sys.path:\n            sys.path.append('src')\n        from src.utils import check_input_type\n        str_type = check_input_type(img_file_one)\n        if str_type == 'unknown':\n            continue\n\n        img_file_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'image_file_%s' % str(uuid.uuid4()))\n        if str_type == 'url':\n            if 'src' not in sys.path:\n                sys.path.append('src')\n            from src.utils import download_image\n            img_file_one = download_image(img_file_one, img_file_path)\n            #
